By monitoring the key metrics in real time in **Internet Information Services** (IIS), you can optimize the server performance and improve the system stability by quickly detecting potential problems. You can also predict and take actions in advance against any impact caused by traffic increase or change in applications.

## Performance monitoring

These are items used to evaluate the performance and stability of the web server. Each item traces the server's operation status and performance and helps you quickly find potential problems. The administrator can monitor these metrics and use them for reference to optimize the server performance and troubleshoot issues.

- **_Pipeline Instance Count_**

  Number of active pipeline instances. It indicates the number of HTTP requests being processed simultaneously. If this value increases, it indicates that the server got overloaded.

- **_Worker Process Restarts_**

  Number of restarted times because the worker process was terminated abnormally. If this metric value increases unexpectedly, investigate the problem as quickly as possible. It is used to evaluate the stability and reliability of applications.

- **_Requests Rejected_**

  Number of requests rejected by the server. It indicates the number of requests that return a 503 HTTP status code. This can be generated by too much server load or exceeding the set limits.

- **_Requests Queued_**

  Number of pending requests. It is the number of requests that the server cannot process. If the value is high, the server performance can be affected.

- **_Current Connections_**

  Number of active TCP connections. You can use it as a reference to check the server's load and trace the network resource usage.

- **_Requests/Sec_**

  Number of HTTP requests processed per second. It is the value measured for the application's throughput, which should remain constant within a specific range, excluding other server operations (garbage collection, cache cleanup threads, external server tools, etc.).

- **_Errors Total/Sec_**

  Number of errors that occurred while executing HTTP requests. It is the sum of compilation errors, preprocessing errors, and execution errors. You can see it to identify problems with the applications or servers.

- **_ISAPI Extension Requests/sec_**

  Number of ISAPI extension requests processed per second. Tasks such as user authentication, database access, and content filtering can all be performed through ISAPI extensions. Through this metric, you can have insight into how frequently the web server are processing dynamic tasks.

## Tracing the network status and data transfer

These items are used to trace the server's network activities and data transfer volumes. These metrics help you evaluate the server's network performance and analyze traffic patterns. By monitoring the data transfer volumes and file transfer speeds, you can trace changes in network traffic and optimize the usage of resources.

- **_Bytes Sent/sec_**

  Bytes transferred per second. It can be used as a reference to trace the server's network activities and analyze traffic patterns.

- **_Bytes Received/sec_**

  Bytes received per second. It can be used as a reference to trace the amount of data transferred from clients to the server.

- **_Files Sent/sec_**

  Number of files transferred per second. You can reference it to trace the activities of file services and check the disk I/O usage.

- **_Files Received/sec_**

  Number of files received per second. It can be used as a reference to trace the file transfer activities from clients.
