## Download agent

After getting the **access key**, select your OS running. In the **_Download agent_** section, copy the command for the OS to install the agent.

The PHP agent installation method is **Linux package installation**. You can install it in the following order.

1. Register the WhaTap **repository**.

2. Install the whatap-php **Linux package** (yum, apt-get).

3. Run the **configuration script**. Through the configuration script, the tracer is registered as **PHP extension module**, and the agent runs by the **whatap-php service**.

4. **Restart** Apache or PHP-FPM.

:::note

For more information about the agent file structure, see the PHP agent file structure.

:::

The agent file consists of the tracers that extracts information for application monitoring and delivers it to the WhaTap collection server, the agents to transmit the collected information to the server, and the installation script files to dynamically apply the tracers and agents to the server. For more information about the agent files, see the following.

  This library is added as a PHP extension module that has been registered as a tracer to collect data and send the collected data to the agent. The extension modules are classified for each PHP API version and Zend Thread Safe support. Examples are as follows:
