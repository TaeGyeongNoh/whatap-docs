Select Home > Select Project > ***Dashboard*** > ***Container Map*** > Target, and then in <Cmdname sid="BTN07712" className="uitext" />, select the ***Event*** tab.

It provides records for all events that occur during the resource lifecycle. The events provided in WhaTap Kubernetes Monitoring are as follows:

- Kubernetes Event (***Kubernetes***)
- WhaTap event (***WhaTap***)

## Basic screen guide

![Kubernetes Display Detail Event tab](/img/k8s-event-default2.png)

- By selecting a ![number 1](/img/number-01.png) Kubernetes event or WhaTap event, you can see the event details. 

  - Selecting all or multiple blocks

    You can search ***All Kubernetes events*** or ***All WhatTap events*** when all or multiple blocks are selected from ***Container Map*** and the card on the left.

  - Selecting clustering or individual block

    When selecting ***Step 2*** grouping or individual block at the top of ***Container Map***, you can view the event. For more information about the **grouping** (clustering), see [the following](container-group).

    :::note

    Before entering the **Display Detail** screen, depending on the view or grouping selected at the top of ***Container Map***, the events that can be viewed may differ.

    :::

- Through the ![number 2](/img/number-02.png) time selector, you can set the time zone to view. The default value is ***1 day***.

- Through the ![number 3](/img/number-03.png) bar chart, you can see the ***Trend of number of events*** in the selected time zone.

- Through the ![number 4](/img/number-04.png) event list, you can see the event records. 

  - ***Kubernetes*** events

    - You can see the data by selecting a desired event type: <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span> or <span class='slow'>Warning</span>. These event types are identical to the event types provided by Kubernetes.

    - The bars on the left for each event indicate the event types. Gray indicates <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span> and orange <span class='slow'>Warning</span>.

  - ***WhaTap*** events

    - Select a desired event level to search among <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>, <span class='k8s-normal'>Info</span>, and <span class='slow'>Warning</span>.

    - The bars on the left for each event indicate the event levels. The gray indicates <span class='k8s-normal'>Info</span>, the orange <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and the red <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>.

## Kubernetes event

***Kubernetes*** event is the event data provided by Kubernetes. In the Kubernetes environment, you can use the `kubectl get events` command to get the event data of the Kubernetes cluster.

```bash

$ kubectl get events -A

However, the event data is not stored continuously. The events that occurred after a specified time are no longer available. 

WhaTap Kubernetes collects and stores all Kubernetes events that occurred in the user cluster environment. Event data such as pod, ReplicaSet, deployment, and namespace is provided according to the target to check.

![Kubernetes event](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_kubernetes_container_map_event_k8s.png)

The bars on the left of each event indicate the event types. Gray indicates <span class='k8s-normal'>Normal</span> and orange <span class='slow'>Warning</span>. Available Kubernetes events according to the selected target are as follows:

Kubenetes events stored in WhaTap consists of `message`, `namespace`, `kind`, `name`, `reason` and `type`.

## WhaTap event

***WhaTap*** events occur depending on the event conditions registered by the event configuration. Under the ***Event*** tab on the detailed view screen of ***Container Map***, you can see the list of events based on the WhaTap alert settings. 

![WhaTap event](https://img.whatap.io/media/images/whatap_kubernetes_container_map_event_whatap.png)

The bars on the left of each event indicate the event levels. The gray indicates <span class='k8s-normal'>Info</span>, the orange <span class='slow'>Warning</span>, and the red <span class='vslow'>Critical</span>. Available WhaTap events according to the selected target are as follows:

| Selected target  | Provided event                                              |
