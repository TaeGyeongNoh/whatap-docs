Agent installation steps to monitor applications such as Java, Python, and Node.js in containers.

The installation of micro-application agent is the same as the procedure of Application Monitoring Agent Installation. The difference is that the containerization task has been added. 

To proceed with installation of the application agent, in the list on the left of **_Management_** > **_Agent Installation_**, click the **_Additional installation of application monitoring_** tab under **_Additional installation_**, and then click **_Additional installation of application monitoring_** at the bottom.

:::caution

The **access key** cannot be duplicated for other projects, and it is different from the **cluster project** authentication key.
