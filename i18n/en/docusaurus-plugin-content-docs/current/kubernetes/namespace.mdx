You can manage namespace projects through the **_Namespace Management_** menu in the cluster project(<code class='my'>CP</code>). In a namespace project, you cannot enter the menu.

:::note

A list box is provided to move to any sub-namespace, or **_Namespace Status_** and **_Namespace management_** in **_Dashboard_** > **_Container Map_** of the cluster project.

## Managing a namespace project

<ImgLang img='k8s-namespace-mng.png' desc='Namespace Management' />

In the ![number-1](/img/number-01.png) area at the top, you can see the total number of targets and the number of key resources. In the ![number-2](/img/number-02.png) **_Namespace List_** area, you can search, add, and delete namespace projects.

### Creating a namespace project

In **_Namespace List_**, select **_+ Add Project_** for the item to create a project for. When the **_Add Project_** window appears, select **_OK_**.

:::note 

**Cautions**

When you add a namespace project, the namespace is separated from the cluster project (<code class='my'>CP</code>) into a separate WhaTap project. The added namespace project is given a new **project access key**. 

If the application monitoring has been installed in a separate namespace, you have to change the **project access key** in the application monitoring settings to the **project access key** of the newly added namespace project.

:::

### Deleting a namespace project

1. Select ![Configuration icon](/img/ico-setting.svg) **_Configuration_** to the utmost right of the project to delete in the **_Namespace List_**.

2. Go to **_Project Management_**.

3. Select **_Delete Project_** on the upper right of the screen.

:::caution

If a namespace project is deleted, the user list and the collected data are all deleted. Note that the deleted data cannot be restored.
