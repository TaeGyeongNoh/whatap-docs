Home > Select Cluster Project > **_Management_** > **_Kubernetes Agent List_** 

You can go to **_Kubernetes Agent List_** under **_Management_** for the cluster project (<code class='my'>CP</code>). 

<ImgLang img='k8s-agent-list.png' desc='Kubernetes agent list' />

- You can see the installation progress of the Kubernetes agent. If some agents are not installed (**_UNINSTALLED_**) or inactive (**_INACTIVE_**), data collection may be distorted, so quick checking is required. 

  > e.g. **_UNINSTALLED_**, **_ACITVE_**, **_INACTIVE_** in the **_State_** column

- You can check the **_CPU Limit_** assigned to the master agent and the installed **_node agent count_**. 

  > For example, if the **_node agent count_** is 50 or more, it is recommended to set the master agent's **_CPU Limit_** to 500 millicores or more.

- You can see the CPU and memory allocated to the node where the agent has been installed. 

  > e.g. **_CapacityCpu_**, **_CapacityMemory_** under the **_Node Info_** column 

- You can see the nodes on which the agents are not installed. 

- You can see the key data of the agent. 

- You can find the guide to the node agent version.

  > e.g. Mismatch notification upon version discrepancy between nodes

:::note 

**Master agent's resource allocation**

Because the amount of data collected and processed by the WhaTap agent differs depending on the size of the user's Kubernetes environment (or node count), sufficient resource allocation to the master agent is required. For example, if **_node agent count_** is so great, it is recommended to increase the master agent's **_CPU limit_**.

#### Refresh

If the ![Refresh icon](/img/ic-refresh2.svg) **_Refresh_** icon is selected at the top, you can update the data based on the current time.

#### Select Column

When using the **_Select column_** option, you can select a desired agent to view the agent list. 

- The selected column list is kept even if you re-enter the menu.

- If you select **_Reset_**, the predefined default key metric columns are selected. In this case, the column selection history is deleted.

- After selecting a column, you can click **_Apply_** at the lower right to apply the selected values.

#### Download

If the ![CSV download icon](/img/ico-csv.svg) **_Download_** icon is selected, you can download the data in the CSV format by setting the **_range_** and **_display option_**. 

#### Display Detail

If you select the ![Details icon](/img/ico-detail-view.svg) icon in the master agent's **_Detail_** column, the detailed information window appears on the right. You can see the **_environment variables_**, **_heap histograms_**, **_thread list/dump_**, and **_agent logs_**. 

In the node agent list, if you select the ![Detail icon](/img/ico-detail-view.svg) icon in the **_Detail_** column of the agent to view, the detailed information window for the node appears on the right.

### <Cmdname sid="TTL08441" className="uitext" type="node" />

It provides a summary of the node configuration and overall resource usage selected in the<Cmdname sid="TTL08441" className="uitext" type="node" /> tab. You can comprehensively see the hardware and software components of the node. Users can monitor resource usage of nodes and the status of each component, as well as performance and operational stability.

<ImgLang img='k8s-node-timeline-config.png' />

- **Node system specifications**

  - **_Architecture_**: Hardware architecture used by the node.

  - **_Image_**: Information about the operating system image that the node is running on.

  - **_CapacityMemory_**: Total memory capacity of the node.

  - **_CapacityCpu_**: Total CPU capacity of the node.

- **Software configuration** 

  - **_Container Runtime_**: Version of the container runtime used on the node. 

  - **_kubelet_**: Version of the Kubernetes kubelet running on the node. 

  - **_kube-proxy_**: Version of the kube-proxy that manages the network features. 

- **Resource usage status** 

  - **_CPU_**: CPU usage of the node.

  - **_Memory_**: Memory usage of the node.

  - **_Disk_**: Disk capacity and usage rate on the node.

  - **_Network_**: Network throughput 

:::note 

- If you click CPU, memory, disk, or network, the <Cmdname sid="metrics" className="uitext" /> tab appears that can display the usage trend for the query period. 

- By clicking **_AVG_** and **_MAX_**, you can see the average usage and maximum usage for the query period.

:::

### <Cmdname sid="resource" className="uitext" />

<Cmdname sid="resource" className="uitext" /> In the tab, you can see the list of ***Pods*** scheduled on the selected node and the ***containers*** and ***applications*** running in those Pods. The information appears reflecting 1 minute of resource data as of the end of the selected time zone. This allows you to more clearly identify the node status at the time point and the operation status of each Pod, container, and application.

<ImgLang img='k8s-node-timeline-resource.png' />

### <Cmdname sid="metrics" className="uitext" />

You can check the resource usage trend of the node select in the <Cmdname sid="metrics" className="uitext" /> tab. You can check the usage changes in ***CPU***, ***memory***, ***network***, and ***disk*** based on the average (***AVG***) and maximum (***MAX***) values during the query period.

<ImgLang img='k8s-node-timeline-metrics.png' />

- **_AVG_**: Average usage for the query period.

- **_MAX_**: Maximum usage for the query period.

- **_Total_**: Total traffic usage across multiple network interfaces.

- **_In/Out_**: Inbound (receiving) and outbound (sending) traffic usage for a specific network interface.

### <Cmdname sid="trace" className="uitext" />

You can see the trace information of the applications running on the node selected in the <Cmdname sid="trace" className="uitext" /> tab.

<ImgLang img='k8s-resource-node-list-trace.png' />

### <Cmdname sid="event" className="uitext" />

You can check ***K8s Node events*** and ***WhaTap Node events*** that occurred on the node selected in the <Cmdname sid="event" className="uitext" /> tab. ***K8s node events*** include important activity logs within the cluster such as changes in node status, while ***WhaTap node events*** provide information about the events triggered based on the user-defined alert criteria.
