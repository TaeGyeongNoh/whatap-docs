**Requirements**

- WhaTap Master Agent 1.7.8 or later is required. 

- If it is a Kubernetes cluster project (<code class='my'>CP</code>), you can view the corresponding menu.

:::

It views <Cmdname sid="side_nodeDiskList" className="uitext" />. You can easily check the status of disks by monitoring the current usage, free space, and performance meetrics of individual disks mounted on each node in real time in <Cmdname sid="side_nodeDiskList" className="uitext" /> for WhaTap Kubernetes Monitoring. This allows you to efficiently manage disk resources in the cluster and proactively find and respond to potential problems.

## Basic screen guide

You can check the list of nodes existing in the cluster and the list of disks mounted on the node as follows. The list is displayed based on the disk information collected over the last minute based on the query time.

#### Sorting the node names

When the disk lists belonging to the same node are listed consecutively, the node names (***OnodeName***) are merged for display. However, if continuity is broken due to sorting by other columns, the merge is also released. 

#### Hidden node disk

When the WhaTap Kubernetes agent runs, the lists of disks mounted on each node appear. The disk does appear in the list in the following cases: 

- The disk must have been mounted to a specific path to display in the list. **The disks that do not have any mount point** do not appear in the list.

- **The disks added after the WhaTap Kubernetes agent runs** do not appear in the list. 

{/* - **마운트 포인트**: 디스크가 특정 경로에 마운트되어 있어야 목록에 표시됩니다. The disks that do not have any mount point do not appear in the list.

- **Real-time monitoring**: You can monitor the usage, free space, and I/O performance metrics for the mounted disks in real time. This allows you to continuously trace the status of the disks and respond quickly if necessary.

- **Constraints**: Disks added after agent startup are not automatically updated in the list. Restart the agent to monitor the added disks. */}
