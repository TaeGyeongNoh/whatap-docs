### Top charts

You can check information for the following four charts:

- ***CPU Usage***: You can see the CPU usage of the node.

- ***Memory Usage***: You can see the memory usage of the node.

- ***Network***: You can see the input/output traffic and error packets of the node's network interface.

- ***Disk Usage***: You can see the disk usage of the node. 

### Container and Pod details

#### Container

When you select the ***Container*** tab, at the top of the container details within the node, you can see the sum of the following metrics: `cpu_quota`, `cpu_request`, `cpu_total_milli`, `mem_limit`, `mem_request`, and `mem_working_set`. 

- If you select a desired column, you can search the container list sorted by that column. 

- If you select a container, the ***Container list*** menu appears. For more information, see [the following](resource-container-list).
