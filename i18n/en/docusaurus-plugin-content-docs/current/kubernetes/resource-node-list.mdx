:::note

If the data for specific columns does not appear, your Kubernetes node agent may be outdated. In this case, update the Kubernetes agent to the 1.3.7 or later so that enough data can be collected. 

:::

You can check the node information of the current project in a list.

- Real-time data is updated every 10 seconds.

- It provides the functions for node status summary, comparison, filtering, and _CSV_ file download.

## Basic screen guide

<ImgLang img='k8s-resource-node-list-m.png' desc='Node list basic screen' />

You can see data by selecting a desired option at the top of <Cmdname sid="node_list" className="uitext" />.

- You can see the number of all nodes and the numbers of nodes for each state.

- If you select a desired column, you can search by sorting <Cmdname sid="node_list" className="uitext" /> based on the selected column. 

## Metric information

import K8slistmetric from "../common-items/_k8s-list-metric.mdx";

<K8slistmetric />

## Filtering

import K8slistfilter from "../common-items/_k8s-list-filter.mdx";

<K8slistfilter />

## Select Column

import K8slistcl from "../common-items/_k8s-list-cl.mdx";

<K8slistcl />

## Comparing

The **_Compare_** option allows you to see a comparison chart of key metrics for multiple nodes. When you select the **_Compare_** check boxes of the nodes to view in the list, a window comparing details for the nodes appears on the right as shown below. 

<ImgLang img='k8s-resource-node-list-compare.png' desc='Compare' />

## View Detailed {#node-list-details}

Node details can be checked through the **_Detail_** option for details on the selected node. If you select the ![Detail icon](/img/ico-detail-view.svg) icon in the **_Detail_** column of the node to view in the list, the detailed information window for the node appears on the right. 

import K8snodedt from "../common-items/_k8s-node-details.mdx";

<K8snodedt />

The **_Node details_** screen consists of the four charts mentioned above and Container details within the node. You can select a desired node to search through the node selector.

- Top charts

  You can check information for the following four charts:

  - **_CPU Usage_**: You can see the CPU usage of the node.

  - **_Memory Usage_**: You can see the memory usage of the node.

  - **_Network_**: You can see the input/output traffic and error packets of the node's network interface.

  - **_Disk Usage_**: You can see the disk usage of the node. 

- Contain details 

  - At the top of the container details within the node, you can see the sum of the following metrics: `cpu_quota`, `cpu_request`, `cpu_total_milli`, `mem_limit`, `mem_request`, and `mem_working_set`. 

  - The Container details provide the following:
