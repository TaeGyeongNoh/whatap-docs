:::note

If the data for specific columns does not appear, your Kubernetes node agent may be outdated. In this case, update the Kubernetes agent to the 1.3.7 or later so that enough data can be collected. 

:::

You can check the node information of the current project in a list.

- Real-time data is updated every 10 seconds.

- It provides the functions for node status summary, comparison, filtering, and _CSV_ file download.

## Basic screen guide

<ImgLang img='k8s-resource-node-list-m.png' desc='Node list basic screen' />

By selecting desired options in the ![number 01](/img/number-01.png) area, you can view the data in ![number 02](/img/number-02.png). 

- On the upper left of the ![number 01](/img/number-01.png) area, you can see the total node count and the node counts for each status.

- When you select **_→ View previous version_** on the right of the ![number 01](/img/number-01.png) area, you can check the **_node list_** before reorganization.

- When selecting a desired column in the ![number 02](/img/number-02.png) area, you can sort the nodes based on the corresponding column. 

- When selecting the ![detail icon](/img/ic-pageview.svg) **_Detail_** icon under the OnodeName column in the ![number 02](/img/number-02.png) area, the corresponding node details page appears.

## Node details {#nodedetails}

The **_Node details_** screen consists of the four charts mentioned above and Container details within the node. You can select a desired node to search through the node selector.

<ImgLang img='k8s-resource-node-detail.png' desc='Node Details screen' />

- Top charts

  You can check information for the following four charts:

  - **_CPU Usage_**: You can see the CPU usage of the node.

  - **_Memory Usage_**: You can see the memory usage of the node.

  - **_Network_**: You can see the input/output traffic and error packets of the node's network interface.

  - **_Disk Usage_**: You can see the disk usage of the node. 

- Contain details 

  - At the top of the container details within the node, you can see the sum of the following metrics: `cpu_quota`, `cpu_request`, `cpu_total_milli`, `mem_limit`, `mem_request`, and `mem_working_set`. 

  - The Container details provide the following:
