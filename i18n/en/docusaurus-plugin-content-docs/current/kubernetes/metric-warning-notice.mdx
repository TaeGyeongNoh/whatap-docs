> The CPU usage of `${oname}` is `${cpu}`% >= 70%.

#### **_Node memory utilization notification_**

The alert occurs when the node's memory utilization (`${memory_pused}`) is 90% or more. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> The memory usage of `${oname}` is `${memory_pused}`% >= 90%.

#### **_Unassignable node notification_**

The corresponding alert occurs when the available number of Pods that can be assigned to a node is zero. 

#### **_APDEX_**

The alert occurs when the transaction exists and the APDEX score is less than 0.7. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

The alert occurs when the number of Pods that can be allocated to the node is 0. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> APDEX is lower than 0.7 (`${oname}`)

{/* 

#### **_HPA CPU utilization notification_**

The alert occurs when the number of running Pods is equal to the maximum number of Pods in the resource and the CPU utilization is above 70%. The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> The maximum HPA POD generation has been reached and the CPU usage is >= 70%.

#### **_HPA memory utilization notification_**

This alert occurs when the number of running Pods is equal to the maximum allowable number of Pods for resources and the memory utilization is greater than 90%.
