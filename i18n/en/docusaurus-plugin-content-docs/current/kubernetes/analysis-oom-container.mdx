Through the <Cmdname sid="side_oomContainer" className="uitext" /> menu, you can quickly search for containers where **Out Of Memory** (**OOM**) occurred and check the change trend in memory usage. This change trend may be sudden or gradual. By checking this, you can objectively determine the appropriate number of PODs and the memory threshold.

:::note 

**Example of OOM occurrence**

Out Of Memory occurs when the container's memory usage exceeds its limit, or the node on which the container is running encounters an out-of-memory condition. If the container exits with the code `137`, it indicates that `SIGKILL` has been received by Out Of Memory.
