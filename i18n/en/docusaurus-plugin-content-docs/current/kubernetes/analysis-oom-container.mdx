Home > Select Project > **_Container_** > **_Out Of Memory Killed Container_**

Through the **_Out Of Memory Killed Container_** menu, you can quickly search for containers where **Out Of Memory** (**OOM)** occurred, and you can check changes in the memory usage (abrupt or gradual) at each time. This allows an objective determination of the eligible number of PODs and the memory thresholds.

:::note 

**Example of OOM occurrence**

Out Of Memory occurs when the container's memory usage exceeds its limit, or the node on which the container is running encounters an out-of-memory condition. If the container exits with the code `137`, it indicates that `SIGKILL` has been received by Out Of Memory.
