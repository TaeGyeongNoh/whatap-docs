You can check the socket information that the Java application opened to perform TCP features. This can be used to view the network dependency, which is the external system that the application instance depends on, such as database. You can also trace who it is making outbound calls to. This information is important for optimizing the efficiency, reliability, and performance of TCP communications. 

- <Cmdname sid="count" className="uitext" />: It indicates the number of connection attempts to external systems.

- <Cmdname sid="stack" className="uitext" />: By selecting <Cmdname sid="get_stack" className="uitext" />, the stacks acquired on the next connections can be viewed and deleted.

It can sort by <Cmdname sid="count" className="uitext" /> and then check <Cmdname sid="host" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="port" className="uitext" /> to find which services or systems have the most connections. Afterwards, obtain <Cmdname sid="stack" className="uitext" /> to view the detailed content.

:::note 

**Database and connection pool**

For example, if the <Cmdname sid="count" className="uitext" /> of 3306 <Cmdname sid="port" className="uitext" /> increases, it is possible that MySQL is not managing connections properly, such as not using the connection pool or frequently disconnecting and recreating the connection pool. To check whether the 3306 <Cmdname sid="port" className="uitext" /> is being used in which code path, you can obtain <Cmdname sid="stack" className="uitext" /> for tracing.
