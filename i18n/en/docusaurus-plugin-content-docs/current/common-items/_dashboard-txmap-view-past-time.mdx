## Viewing the past data

<Cmdname sid="transaction_map" className="uitext" /> provides the real-time monitoring by default. By default, the data can be viewed in real time for 5 minutes. Click the green button in the time selector to select a desired lookup time.

To view the historical data, select ![Pause icon](/img/ico-pause.svg) in the time selector. It changes to period viewing mode and you can view the transaction data for up to 10 minutes. The chart data of <Cmdname sid="transaction_map" className="uitext" /> based on the date and time set by the user is refreshed.

:::note

- The range of the historical inquiries may differ depending on the transaction volume.

- To switch to the Realtime mode after a historical inquiry, select ![Playback icon](/img/ico-play-time.svg).
