## Guide to major features

The <Cmdname sid="side_integratedReport" className="uitext" /> menu provide the following features:

- **Supporting multiple projects**

  It is convenient to be able to generate reports at once by selecting multiple projects. The <Cmdname sid="side_report" className="uitext" /> menu available in any project can generate reports only for a desired project.

- **Create Report by Kind**

  In the <Cmdname sid="create_report" className="uitext" /> feature, you can select projects by the work unit to save as a template. This feature is useful in the Micro Service Architecture (MSA) environment where projects are usually divided by the
  work unit.

- **Big Data Optimization**

  With an aid of this, the report creation time has been drastically reduced. Even if an error occurs while creating a project report, you can view the result of the report.

- **Simultaneous operation during report generation**

  You can do other tasks while generating a report. In the <Cmdname sid="side_report" className="uitext" /> menu available in any project, you must wait until the report generation is completed.

  In <Cmdname sid="side_integratedReport" className="uitext" />, you can go to another page while creating a report. You can also see its progress and view the created report from the report result list.

- **Sharing the report work**

  Any user with project permission can view the created reports. You can check whether the related report has already been created, so you can avoid creating duplicates.

## Difference between the report and integrated report

The <Cmdname sid="side_report" className="uitext" /> menu available in any project generates reports for the project. You can access it through <Cmdname sid="side_report" className="uitext" /> or <Cmdname sid="side_reportStat" className="uitext" /> in the side menu after selecting a project on the initial screen.

The <Cmdname sid="side_integratedReport" className="uitext" /> menu can generate reports for multiple projects. It can be accessed from Home screen without selecting a project.

:::tip

The methods how to set the query period depending on the format of the selected report are as follows:

- **Daily report**: You can select the start/end date and time.

- **Weekly report**: Simply select a start date. Then the end date is selected automatically after calculation.

- **Monthly report**: Simply select a start date. Then the end date is selected automatically after calculation.

  - If the start date is the 1st date, up to the end of the month is automatically selected.

  - If the start date is not the 1st date, up to the date before the next month is automatically selected.

Example 1: If the start date is **January 1**, from **January 1 00:00:00** to **January 31 23:59:59** is automatically selected.

Example 2: If the start date is **January 10**, from **January 10 00:00:00** to **February 9 23:59:59** is automatically selected.
