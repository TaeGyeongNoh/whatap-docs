## Difference between the report and integrated report

   - **Saving and importing report forms**

<ImgLang img='integration_report_03.png' />

You can see the reports that were created and are being created in <Cmdname sid="generation_report_list" className="uitext" />.

In the <Cmdname sid="all" className="uitext" /> list, as well as the reports created by you, the reports created by other people with the same permission can be seen. In the <Cmdname sid="my_report" className="uitext" /> list, you can see your own reports after being filtered.

A report created with no error has the <span class='woer'>![Check icon](/img/ic-check-bl.svg) check</span> icon. In case of a report with any error, the <span class='wer'>![Warning icon](/img/ic-warning-org.svg) warning</span> icon is displayed together. If you click the <span class='wer'>![Warning icon](/img/ic-warning-org.svg) warning</span> icon, you can see in which project the error occurred.
