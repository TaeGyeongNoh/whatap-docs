**BCI(ByteCode Instrumentation)**

Java bytecode is a platform-independent intermediate code that runs on the JVM. **BCI** (byte code injection), is a technique to implement additional functionality by dynamically changing the bytecode at runtime or build time without modifying the source file. For more information, see the following document.

{/* :::note 

**Class multi-layered structure and resources**

Due to the multi-layered nature of Java applications, it is required to check the **_resource_** information. For example, in complex application environments such as Tomcat server, finding exactly which _jar_ file a class is loaded from can help prevent class conflicts, debug, and optimize the performance. 

- **Avoiding class conflicts** 

  If the same class exists in multiple _jar_ files, you can avoid class conflicts by checking which _jar_ file the class was loaded from. 
- **Debugging** 

  Unintended behaviors or bugs may occur if a specific class is loaded from a _jar_ file different from the expected one. Verifying this makes debugging easier. 
- **Performance optimization** 

  If you are experiencing performance issues when loading classes, you can manage the performance by finding which _jar_ file overloads classes.

It can provide snapshot information of all threads in the Java process. **_Thread list/dump_** is a key menu for CPU optimization. You can manage CPU resources more finely by checking the status at the thread level rather than the process level. For example, you can identify performance issues by checking the thread that is using the most CPU at the time of query and then checking the stack information for the thread.

- **_Thread dump_**: You can generate a full thread dump by clicking <code class='my'>Thread dump</code> on the upper right. After generating a full thread dump, you can check the information at the bottom of the thread list. 

- Individual thread dump: You can see individual thread dump information by selecting the ![Expand icon](/img/ico-expander.svg) icon for each thread. **_Stack_** and **_Stack trace_** provide the details about thread status and execution path, as well as stack traces. ![Refresh icon](/img/ico-refresh.png) The list can be checked after refreshing it.

:::note 

**CPU usage spike types**

- Heap memory is full: CPU usage spikes due to frequent GC. 

- There are lots of requests: CPU usage spikes due to processing a large number of client requests. 

- Wrong code logic: Inefficient algorithms or infinite loops can cause spikes in CPU usage.

:::

{/* 기술 방식 선택 필요 다음 내용을 활용 안내로? */}

{/* 델타값 추가 시 이미지 교체 필요! 

The following guides you to three types of issues: In case the heap memory is full, in case there are lots of requests, and in case there is a logic problem.

*/}

{/* CPU 사용률이 급증한 경우는 여러가지 원인에 기인할 수 있습니다. We can categorize these issues into three types: in case the heap memory is full, in case there are lots of requests, and in case there is a logic problem.

The first thing to check is the heap memory, which is easy to identify. If the heap memory is full, the JVM performs GC frequently, which may cause CPU usage to spike. Especially when a full GC occurs, the application temporarily stops operation and the CPU usage increases significantly. For example, if the application has a memory leak where objects are not properly freed and are occupying memory, heap memory may become insufficient. The JVM repeatedly runs the GC to reclaim memory, causing CPU usage to spike. 

If there are lots of requests actually where the applications process a large number of client requests, it results in high CPU utilization. Each request is processed by creating a Java thread, causing the CPU to perform a lot of work. 

An example is to be a large-scale discount event on a shopping mall site that results in a spike in web surfer traffic. When a large number of users visit a website, the server generates many threads to process a large number of HTTP requests, which significantly increases the CPU usage.

The third is the case when the problem is caused by a wrong code logic. If the application code contains inefficient algorithms or infinite loops, it may abnormally result in a high CPU usage. */}

<ImgLang img='ipa-open-socket-java.png' desc='Opened Socket Count' />

You can check the socket information that the Java application opened to perform TCP features. This can be used to view the network dependency, which is the external system that the application instance depends on, such as database. You can also trace who it is making outbound calls to. This information is important for optimizing the efficiency, reliability, and performance of TCP communications. 

- **_Count_**: It indicates the number of connection attempts to external systems. 

- **_Stack_**: By selecting **_Get stack_**, you can view and delete the stacks acquired during your next connection. 

You can sort by **_Count_** and then check the **_host_** and **_port_** to see which services or systems have the most connections. After that, secure the **_stack_** and check the details. 

:::note 

**Database and connection pool**

For example, if the **_count_** on the **_port_** 3306 is high, there is a possibility that MySQL is not managing connections properly, such as not using a connection pool or frequently disconnecting and recreating the connection pool. You can get the **_stack_** and trace it to find out which code path is using the 3306 **_port_**.

:::

{/* 

Related usage examples are recorded in Notion for 39 minutes.

For example, to check which logic is used to determine which port with a high **_count_** is used, you can obtain the **_stack_** and then view the details. 

For example, if the **_count_** on the port 3306 that is mainly used by MySQL is high, the connections are managed.

If the **_Count_** that indicates the number of connection attempts and 

the number of connection attempts to a specific external system (**_count_**) is high 

You can see the socket information opened by the Java application to perform TCP functions. Querying network dependencies that determine which external systems an application instance depends on, is important for optimizing the efficiency, reliability, and performance of TCP communications.

By calling `System.gc()`, you can collect and remove memory objects (garbage) that are no longer needed for the dynamically allocated memory in the Heap area of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). If you select **_Run GC_**, the GC process is performed and you can see the memory capacity before and after execution.

:::note 

**System GC and memory leak**

When the heap memory usage continues to rise, the **_System GC_** is required to accurately identify and diagnose the possibility of memory leak. 

- **Memory requested or not**: Check if the application is continuously requesting memory. Check if memory requests increased more than expected or memory is being freed correctly.

- **Checking memory usage**: Check if excessive memory usage is happening. Run GC to free objects that are no longer required and observe changes in memory usage. 

- **GC cycle**: Check if GC is not running even if there is sufficient free memory. Check the GC cycle or settings.
