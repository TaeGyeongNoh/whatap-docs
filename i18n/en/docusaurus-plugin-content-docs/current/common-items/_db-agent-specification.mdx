- **CPU**: Approximately 20 agents can be installed per core (may differ depending on the DB server load).

- **Memory**: 200 MB

- **Disk**: 100 MB (Agent space of 50 MB + Log file generation space of 50 MB)

:::note

Minimum installation requirements based on the number of agents 

| Number of installed agents |   CPU  | Memory | Disk |
| :------------------------: | :----: | :----: | :--: |
|             10             | 1-core |  2 GB  | 1 GB |

<Title level={props.level} hashid="dbagentrunning" >Agent operation method</Title>

The DB agent basically operates in the following way:

- **Execution cycle**: 5 secs (default)

- **Number of queries performed**: 5 to 6

- **Speed**: It terminates within 1 second when the server load is normal.

- Up to 2 sessions (5-second collection session, other information collection session)

When a timeout occurs during collection query, the DB agent operates in the following way to minimize the load.

- Do not run a new collection query until the previous collection query has finished.

- If the timeout exceeds 12 seconds (exceeds 2 refresh cycles), the session is reconnected after termination.

- If timeout occurs 3 times or more, wait 10 seconds and try again.

:::note

Depending on the load status of the DB server, it may take a long time or a timeout may occur until the result of a collection query appears on the WhaTap monitoring service screen.
