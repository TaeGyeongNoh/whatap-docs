It is a list of syntax rules that can be used upon entry of filter. **_Live Tail_** and **_Log Search_** use the same syntax rules.

| Syntax rule   | Example                       | Description                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| include(+)    | `+ote-gateway`                | Filters only those containing `ote-gateway`         |
| ^             | `@txid:+-6611219762256426545` | Filters only when `@txid` is `-6611219762256426545` |
| exclude(-)    | `-ote-gateway`                | Filter except for `ote-gateway`                     |
| startWith(\*) | `ERROR*`                      | Filters only those starting with `ERROR`            |
| endWith(\*)   | `*ERROR`                      | Filters only those ending with `ERROR`              |

:::note

When using the include (+) syntax, to search for the strings containing negative numbers such as "`-`1234," add the `+` symbol and then search for "`+-`1234."
