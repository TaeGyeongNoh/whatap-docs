## Default options

The following are the basic options that can be set for each item.

- <Cmdname sid="inactive_agent_alert" className="uitext" />

  An alert is sent when no data can be received from agents for a set period of time. Select the toggle button to enable or disable the function.

- <Cmdname sid="CNT08320" className="uitext" />

  You can select <Cmdname sid="CNT08320" className="uitext" /> among application event items. This function can be enabled or disabled by selecting the toggle button.

- <Cmdname sid="TTL05989" className="uitext" />

  This alert occurs while collecting metrics redundantly when there are multiple agents with the same ID set among the agents being monitored. Check the related options in the agent settings to make sure there are no duplicate agent names. It is recommended to use this function when an alert occurs due to duplicate agents in deployment such as blue and green. If multiple agents with the same name are launched at the same time, you are not notified for the selected time.

- <Cmdname sid="condition" className="uitext" />

  The ![Leader line 1](/img/number-01.png) condition is the <span class='slow'>warning</span> level. The ![Leader line 2](/img/number-02.png) condition is the <span class='vslow'>critical</span> level.

- ![Leader line 3](/img/number-03.png) <Cmdname sid="continue" className="uitext" />

  It sends a notification if event conditions persist for the selected period of time.

- ![Leader line 4](/img/number-04.png) <Cmdname sid="silent" className="uitext" />

  After sending a notification, the same notification is not to be sent for the selected period of time.

- ![Leader line 5](/img/number-05.png) On/Off
