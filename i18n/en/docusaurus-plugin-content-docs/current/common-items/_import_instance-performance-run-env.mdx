You can view environment variables for agent execution. Important information among environment variables or application status can be stored on the WaTap server so that they can be retrieved even if the agent is down. You can see the version, installation path, name, and IP address of the agent. You can download environment variables by clicking <Cmdname sid="sms_summary_download_csv" className="uitext" />. The following are key points to check: 

- `(Application).version`: You can check the application version. 

- `file.encoding`: You can check the file encoding format such as `utf-8`.

- `os.name`: You can check the current OS.

- `user.language`: You can check the user language.
