- **object_name** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `{type}`-`{ip2}`-`{ip3}`-`{port}`

  It is an agent naming (ONAME) scheme to identify database servers. An OID is created based on the ONAME.

- **auto_oname_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  The function to automatically obtain the agent name (oname) from the server is activated. Upon application, the options for `-Dwhatap.name` and `-Dwhatap.oname` are ignored. It obtains `oname` through communication with the collection server and then starts the agent's normal operation.

- **auto_oname_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `agent`

  When an agent name is automatically granted from the server, the prefix of the agent name (business name as usual) is used. The prefix + serial number (from 1) is assigned.

- **auto_oname_reset** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `0`

  Modify it to obtain a new agent name from the server. If the agent name is automatically granted, the system environment variable, `whatap.oname` is set. Once set, the system environment variables are not changed until the Java instance is restarted. For a reset, modify the value of `auto_oname_reset`. If you change it to a value different from the current setting, it is to be applied.
