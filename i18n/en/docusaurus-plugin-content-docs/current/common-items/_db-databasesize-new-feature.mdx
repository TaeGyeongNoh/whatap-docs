It aggregates the sizes of tables for each database and provides trend data in a chart. You can identify and manage the trend in database capacity growth. You can prepare for rapid capacity increases by identifying them in advance.

Database size can affect the performance. You can prepare to troubleshoot performance issues because the increase in size can delay the query execution. It is also required to identify and prevent problems in advance that may increase the size due to incorrect queries or database structure issues.

The trend in database size helps you understand usage patterns and data growth. You can predict future capacity requirements and take possible actions. Monitoring these changes helps you optimize the resources and costs.

<InDoc product='mysql'>

MySQL database size can be seen in `information_schema.tables`, and the monitoring account must have the table search role for aggregation. Role settings are required as follows.

```sql
grant select on {DB_NAME}.* to whatap;
```

:::note

- The sizes for `information_schema` and `performance_schema` are not collected. 

- The collection cycle is collected once every hour.

<InDoc product='postgresql'>

The total database size is queried with the `pg_database_size` function, and the monitoring account must have the connect or `pg_read_all_stats` role. `template database` is excluded from collection.

Individual table sizes can be queried with the `pg_relation_size`, `pg_indexes_size`, and `pg_total_relation_size` functions, and the query role for the corresponding schema is required.

```sql
grant pg_read_all_stats to whatap;
grant usage on schema {schema_name} to whatap;
```

:::note

- The sizes for the `pg_catalog`, `sys`, `information_schema`, and `pg_toast` schemata are not collected.

- The collection cycle is collected once every hour.

## Basic screen guide

<ProdImg img='db-database-size.png' desc='Database size'/>

1. Set the time to search in <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" />. You can also select a lookup time by clicking the green button.

2. Select a target to view in <Cmdname sid="instance" className="uitext" />.

3. Select ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png).

:::note

- The lookup time can be set up to 62 days. In case of a view for 3 days or more, the graph displays the daily average.

- Select the clock display area to query a random date and time. If you click the text range for date and time, the option appears to select the date and time.

## Checking the changes over time

If you select the graph bar at a specific time in <Cmdname sid="TTL06025" className="uitext" />, you can see the database size trend and change amounts from the start time to the selected time in a list.

## Checking the sizes for each table

If you select a database in <Cmdname sid="TTL06026" className="uitext" />, you can see the list of sizes for each table in the top 50.

<InDoc product='mysql'>

It displays **DATA SIZE**, **INDEX SIZE**, **ROWS** for each table by default. This is the information for `information_schema.tables` and may differ from the actual size. To see the **FILE SIZE** of `information_schema.innodb_tablespaces`, set the following option in the DBX agent. This size is close to the actual size.

```ini title='whatap.conf'
table_filesize=true
```

:::note

It targets the tables for which the monitoring account has the query role. For more information about the monitoring account creation, see [the following](install-agent#uid).

<InDoc product='postgresql,mysql'>

It displays **DATA SIZE** and **INDEX SIZE** for each table. In the table list of the <Cmdname sid="TTL06572" className="uitext" /> section, select the <span class="uitext">TABLENAME</span> column. Then the **_Object detail_** window appears for **columns** and **index** items.

<ImgLang img='db-database-size-objectdetail-postgresql.png' desc='Object detail' />

:::note

This function is supported in DBX agent 1.6.15 or later. For more information about the database roles and related settings, see [the following](install-agent#uid).
