Home &gt; Select Project &gt; ![Icon](/img/ic-sitemap.svg) <Cmdname sid="sitemap" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_event" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_eventSetting" className="uitext" /> <code class="newfunc">New</code>

The new <Cmdname sid="side_eventSetting" className="uitext" /> menu can enhance the user experience by focusing on the field (**Field**) rather than the category (**Category**). This event function allows you to quickly apply warning level notifications to users who do not need powerful features such as metric event settings or to repeatedly use simple notification conditions. By providing basic event templates for the products of the created project, you can quickly and easily configure the desired warning notification events.

By selecting fields first rather than categories, we can resolve the discrepancy between metrics perceived by the user and event settings. By combining the visual intuition of the simulation, you can complete event settings quickly and accurately.

:::note

- New projects can use this feature without extra settings. However, for the created projects, select <Cmdname sid="BTN07682" className="uitext" />. The event lists optimized for new features are automatically generated.

- The provided event templates may differ depending on the product.

- This function can be used by only the members with the <Cmdname sid="sms_alert_settings" className="b500" /> role. For more information about the member roles, see [the following](../project/project-structure#project-auth).
