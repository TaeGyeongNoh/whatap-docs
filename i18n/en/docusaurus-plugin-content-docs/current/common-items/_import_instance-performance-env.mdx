You can view environment variables for application execution. The <Cmdname sid="boot_env" className="uitext" /> menu collects and provides environment variables at the time of query. It uses `System.getProperty()` to retrieve the value of the key passed as a parameter. The following are key points to check: 

- `(Application).version`: You can check the application version. 

- `file.encoding`: You can check the file encoding format such as `utf-8`.

- Application state: For example, if the `catalina.home` environment variable is retrieved, you can see that it is the tomcat environment.

- OS environment variables: For example, they are provided in the suffix `(env)` format, such as `(env) LANG` environment variable.
