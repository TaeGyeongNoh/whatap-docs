You can see the status of DataSource. It provides information for current status and configuration of the database connection pool used by the application, connection settings, connection state, and configuration mismatches. 

:::note 

Because the monitoring starts as soon as a connection pool object is created, it may appear in the data source status even if the object is not being used.
