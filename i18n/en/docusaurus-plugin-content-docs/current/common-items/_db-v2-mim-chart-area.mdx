## Learning about the main widgets {#about-widget}

The types of widgets that can be placed on the dashboard are as follows.

### XOS widgets

- **_[XOS] CPU_**

  You can see the CPU usages for each agent in real time.

- **_[XOS] Memory_**

  You can see the memory usages for each agent in real time.

- **_[XOS] Disk Usage_**

  Displays the disk utilizations, free sizes, and total sizes for each agent. 

  - ![Detail icon](/img/ico-detail.svg): The <Cmdname sid="TTL07856" className="uitext" /> pop-up window appears. You can check the chart that displays the disk usage by time zone. You can check the data by instance. By selecting <UI>Size</UI>, <UI>Free</UI>, or <UI>Used</UI>, you can see the total size, remaining size, and size in use. 

  - ![Zoom in icon](/img/ic-fullscreen.svg): You can expand the table on the widget to a wider screen.

  :::tip

  If there is no data displayed, add the following settings to the _xos.conf_ file.

  ```ini title='xos.conf'
  # Off if the disk usage is 0; unit: second
  disk_usage_interval=60
  ```

### AWS RDS CloudWatch widgets

- **_[RDS] CPUUtilization_**

  You can see the CPU usages for each RDS DB instance in real time.

- **_[RDS] FreeableMemory_**

  You can see the memory usages for each RDS DB instance in real time.

- **_[RDS] FreeStorageSpace_**

  You can see the free storage space in the RDS database in real time.

:::note

For information on how to configure the agent for inquiry of AWS CloudWatch metrics, see [the following](agent-dbx-settings#using-aws-rds).

### Database widgets

- **_Active Sessions_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the number of sessions running queries.

<InDoc product='postgresql'>

- **_DML Tuples_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the number of statements run for DML (Data Manipulation Language).

</InDoc>

<InDoc product='mysql'>

- **_Questions_**

  Number of commands executed by the MySQL server. It differs from the Queries in that it does not count commands executed in a stored program.

</InDoc>

- **_Slow Query_**

  Displays a real-time chart for slow queries for each time zone. If you drag a specific part of the chart, the **_Slow Query List_** appears. You can enlarge or reduce the range of the vertical axis by selecting ![Up arrow icon](/img/up-arrow.svg) or ![Down arrow icon](/img/down-arrow.svg).

<InDoc product="postgresql">

- **_Logical I/O_**

  The `blks_hit` metric provides a real-time chart of the total number of cases where disk blocks were found in the buffer cache and does not require reading.

</InDoc>

<InDoc product="mysql">

- **_Logical I/O_**

  It displays the number of logical read requests including physical reads on the real-time chart. You can calculate the `Innodb buffer pool hit` percentage as follows, and 90% or higher is recommended. If Hit Ratio is low, consider increasing the `Innodb_buffer_pool_size`.

  > `Buffer Hit Ratio` = (1 - (`Innodb_buffer_pool_reads`/`Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests`)) \* 100

</InDoc>

- **_Long Active Session Count_**

  It provides information about active sessions running on the database for long time. A chart appears for information aggregated by time zone with grouped by the session execution time. It can identify long-running sessions with performance issues or resource leaks in the database, or classify the sessions based on the execution time to visually display which sessions stay active for long time.

  It appears in <span class="normal">blue</span> for less than 3 seconds, <span class="snormal">green</span> for 3 seconds or more that is less than 10, <span class='slow'>orange</span> for 10 seconds or more that is less than 15, and <span class='vslow'>red</span> for 15 seconds or more.

- **_Long Waiting Session Count_**

  It provides information about the long-term latency of the sessions holding or waiting for locks in the database. By combining lock information and active session information, you can trace long-term latencies for queued sessions. It monitors the sessions that are holding locks or waiting for long time. You can visually see which sessions are holding locks or waiting for long time.

  It appears in <span class="normal">blue</span> for less than 5 seconds, <span class="snormal">green</span> for 5 seconds or more that is less than 10, <span class='slow'>orange</span> for 10 seconds or more that is less than 60, and <span class='vslow'>red</span> for 60 seconds or more.

- **_SQL Elapse Map_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the elapsed times of running queries. If you drag a specific part of the chart, the **_Query List_** appears. You can enlarge or reduce the range of the vertical axis by selecting ![Up arrow icon](/img/up-arrow.svg) or ![Down arrow icon](/img/down-arrow.svg).

  :::note

  The execution times of queries are calculated after collecting active sessions. Therefore, depending on the active session collection cycle, there may be a margin of error. See the following figure. The execution times of SQL queries that have ended within the collection cycle are not calculated. A shorter collection cycle may decrease the margin of error, but considering the database load, it is typically set to 5 seconds. It is useful for monitoring long-running queries. The same is true for the data in **_SQL statistics_**.

- **_Lock Wait Sessions_**

  Displays a real-time chart for queued counts to acquire the row lock.

<InDoc product='postgresql'>

- **_Commit Count_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the counts of committed transactions.

</InDoc>

<InDoc product='mysql'>

- **_Commit_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the counts of committed transactions.

</InDoc>

- **_Replication Delay_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the delayed times that are reflected in the replication DB in case of the replication structure.

- **_Physical I/O_**

  Displays a real-time chart for the data read counts in the physical disks.

<InDoc product='postgresql'>

- **_Wait Event_**

  If the backend process is currently queued, you can check the queued event names and counts. Hover your mouse over the chart to see the information through a tooltip.

</InDoc>

<InDoc product='mysql'>

- **_Select Full Join_**

  When joining one or more tables (`JOIN`), the number of full scans for driven tables without using any index appears in a real-time chart.

- **_Tmp Tables_**

  Displays a real-time chart for internal temporary table counts created by the server during command execution for each instance.
