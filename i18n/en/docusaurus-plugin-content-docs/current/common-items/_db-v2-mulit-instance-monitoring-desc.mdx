While you can monitor only one agent (instance) in <Link to="instance-monitoring"><Cmdname sid="side_dbMonitoring" className="uitext" /></Link>, <Cmdname sid="side_multiInstance" className="uitext" /> allows you to monitor and manage multiple agents (instances).

You can compare and analyze key performance metrics occurring in each instance at a glance. You can effectively perform monitoring by aggregating data such as the number of agents running, the sum of all active sessions, and the number of transactions. Users can easily check the changes in metric values ​​over time and high performance metrics for each instance through graph charts. 

Additionally, users can see the longest-lasting active sessions, which can be used as a basis for diagnosing and resolving the system performance bottlenecks.
