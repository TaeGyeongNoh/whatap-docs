## Checking the reception status {#check-receive-status}

If you entered an incorrect email address or are cannot receive notifications for any other reason, you can check the notification reception status in the user list of the <Cmdname sid="alert_receive_settings_by_member" className="uitext" /> session.

The notification reception status can be classified as follows. If notifications were not received via email, check the reception status and then take appropriate actions.

- <Cmdname sid="bounce_transient" className="uitext" />: Your email account is disabled or your mailbox is full, which may cause a temporary error when sending notifications. Check the email account status.

- <Cmdname sid="bounce_unsubscribe" className="uitext" />: The notification service has been stopped due to opt-out.

- <Cmdname sid="bounce_permanent" className="uitext" />: The email address does not exist or does not follow the email format, so email reception is limited.

:::note

You can unblock sending only to your own email address.
