## Changing the lookup criteria

Select the chart area of <Cmdname sid="transaction_map" /> and then the button at the upper left to change the data lookup criteria.

- <Cmdname sid="elapsed" className="uitext" />: The data is searched based on the elapsed time of the executed transaction.

- <Cmdname sid="httpcTime" className="uitext" />: The data is searched based on the response time for HTTP calls.

- <Cmdname sid="sqlTime" className="uitext" />: The data is searched based on the SQL patch time.

If you select **_Error_** on the upper right of the chart area, you can view only the transactions with errors. If you drag a transaction on the chart in this state, the <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" /> window that displays a list of erroneous transactions. To view all transactions, select **_Total_**.

**Adjusting the Y-axis**

- You can easily change the maximum value of the Y-axis by selecting ![Up arrow icon](/img/up-arrow.svg) or ![Down arrow icon](/img/down-arrow.svg) on the upper left of the chart. You can also access the same function by pressing the up or down button on the keyboard.

  For more information on how to use the ![Up arrow icon](/img/up-arrow.svg) or ![Down arrow icon](/img/down-arrow.svg) button or keyboard buttons depending on the Y-axis section, see the following:

  - The segment from 10 to 50 seconds is changed to the 10-second interval.

  - The segment from 50 to 300 seconds is changed to the 50-second interval.

  - For the segment of 300 or more seconds, it is changed to the 100-second interval.

- You can change the maximum value of the Y-axis by directly entering it. Select ![Edit icon](/img/ico-edit.svg), enter a desired value, and then select <Cmdname sid="apply" className="uitext" />.
