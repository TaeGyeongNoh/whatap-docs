-   **_Category_**: You can select the log type name (log folder name) from the list or enter it directly.

## Add real-time log event{#rt-log-event}

<ImgLang img='log-alert-rt.png' desc='실시간 로그 이벤트 추가 sc' />

-   **_Search key_** : Its default value is `All`. "All" means the content of the log.

-   **_Search value_**: An alert is sent if the log includes the specified word. You can select any in the list and directly enter it.

-   **_Filtering event targets_**: Select **_Search key_**, **_Operator_**, and **_Search value_** through the **_Selector_** option to filter the targets. Otherwise, select the **_Direct Input_** option. If there is no input, it determines whether or not to generate notifications for all data collected in real time.

    > For example, among the logs in the `AppLog` category, it searches for the logs whose `level` is `ERROR`. An alert is sent when **_oid_** is **12345678** among the matching logs.

## Add composite log event{#cp-log-event}

<ImgLang img='log-alert-cp.png' desc='복합 로그 이벤트 추가 sc' />

-   **_Templates_** : Composite log templates are provided. 

-   **_Log search condition_**

    -   In **_Search key_**, you can select any event rule. You can select any value that meets the selected **_search key_**.

    -   If you add a same item in **_Search key_**, the OR condition works. Otherwise, the AND condition works.

    -   You can select **_Exclude_** to exclude the selected search value from the event rules.

    -   You can select **_+ Add_** to add or exclude multiple event rule conditions.  

-   **_Time Range_**: You can view the logs collected during the selected period. If you select 5 minutes as the time range, the event rule condition is checked after searching for the data collected during the last 5 minutes. 

-   **_Event rule condition_**: Alerts are sent when events occur as many as the entered number and they occur by meeting the selected operator's condition.

    > For example, among the logs in the `AppLog` category, the logs that meet `Enter conditions` are filtered. If **_Exclude_** is checked for condition, it indicates that the logs searched by the condition are excluded. Thus, the logs whose `level` is `ERROR` are excluded. Alerts are sent when the event is less than `5` among the logs collected in the last 10 minutes.
