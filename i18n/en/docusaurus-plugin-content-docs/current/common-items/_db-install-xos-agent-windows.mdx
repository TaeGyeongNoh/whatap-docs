Run the agent with a batch file in the *xos* folder.

```bash
start.bat
```

After confirming that there are no errors in the execution log displayed on the screen and terminating the execution, register for the service in the following order.

- **Service registration**

  Register in the service by running the *install_WindowsService.bat* file in the xos folder as follows. If you do not enter a name after the `create` option, the service is registered by default with the name of **WhatapXOSAgent**.

  ```bash
  install_WindowsService.bat create WhatapXOSAgent
  ```

- **Deletion of a service**

  ```bash
  install_WindowsService.bat delete WhatapXOSAgent
  ```

:::note

To transmit monitored data to the DBX agent, the port set to `dbx_port` (default 3002) must have been open. (**UDP Outbound**)
