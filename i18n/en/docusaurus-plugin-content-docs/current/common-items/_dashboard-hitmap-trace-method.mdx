<ImgLang img="analysis-tx-method-summary.png" desc="Methods" />

To see only the method data, select the <Cmdname sid="TTL06130" className="uitext" /> tab. It displays the method name and step time for which tracing has been set on the agent. When unnecessary logics are repeatedly executed, it can be used as analysis data to improve the method logic by finding the case where the execution takes longer than the low count.

- ![Statistics icon](/img/ic-static.svg): You can see the <Cmdname sid="transaction_statistics" className="uitext" /> information. If a graph on the chart is selected, the <Cmdname sid="side_analysis" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_txSearch" className="uitext" /> menu appears. You can see the list of transactions for the selected time zone.

- ![Download icon](/img/ico-download.svg) <Cmdname sid="TTL06398" className="uitext" />: You can download the method-related details as a TXT file.
