**Preliminary checking**

- Operating system: Linux 

- WhaTap Server Monitoring Agent version: 2.5.4 or later

:::

You can enable the server time synchronization (NTP) monitoring through the following option: 

```bash
echo "ntpq.enabled=true" |sudo tee -a /usr/whatap/infra/conf/whatap.conf
```

### Guide to additional key metrics

The metrics to be added when activating the server time synchronization monitoring are as follows: 

#### `server_ntpq`

| ------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `delay`       | ms     | Time taken for the server to return a reply packet in response to a query.                                                                                                                | -       |

| `reach`       | -      | You can see how successful the attempts to reach the server were. It records the success or failure of the most recent query at the position 2^0 and operates as an 8-bit shift register. | -       |
