## Learning about the main widgets {#about-widget}

The types of widgets that can be placed on the dashboard are as follows.

### XOS widgets

- ***[XOS] CPU***

  You can see the CPU usages for each agent in real time.

- ***[XOS] Memory***

  You can see the memory usages for each agent in real time.

### Oracle RAC widget

- ***[RAC] Load Balance***

  You can monitor the resources of instances running on the Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters) database in real time. Users can visually monitor the load and performance metrics for their database. You can check the CPU performance, active sessions, physical read operations, and available memory.

- ***[RAC] Interconnect Bandwidth***

  This widget monitors the interconnect bandwidth used in Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters). You can monitor the network traffic between databases and instances within a cluster by displaying the communication bandwidth between database nodes in real time.

- ***[RAC] Main Waits***

  You can see the global lock status and the numbers of waits for each event. This widget queries the total number of waits for each event through metrics collected for a specific database category and extracts the most recent data for each agent (instance). This allows you to see the database wait events promptly at a specific time.

### Database widgets

- ***Active Sessions***

  It visually displays the numbers of active sessions over time in a time series chart. This widget traces and graphs the numbers of sessions running in the database over time. It is useful for visually checking the session usage patterns and load.

- ***Lock Wait Sessions***

  It visually displays the numbers of lock waiting sessions over time in a time series chart. This widget traces the numbers of sessions in lock waiting state in the database over time and displays it on the graph in real time.

- ***Long Active Session Count***

  It provides information about active sessions running on the database for long time. A chart appears for information aggregated by time zone with grouped by the session execution time. It can identify long-running sessions with performance issues or resource leaks in the database, or classify the sessions based on the execution time to visually display which sessions stay active for long time.

  It appears in <span class="normal">blue</span> for less than 3 seconds, <span class="snormal">green</span> for 3 seconds or more that is less than 10, <span class='slow'>orange</span> for 10 seconds or more that is less than 15, and <span class='vslow'>red</span> for 15 seconds or more.

- ***Long Waiting Session Count***

  It provides information about the long-term latency of the sessions holding or waiting for locks in the database. By combining lock information and active session information, you can trace long-term latencies for queued sessions. It monitors the sessions that are holding locks or waiting for long time. You can visually see which sessions are holding locks or waiting for long time.

  It appears in <span class="normal">blue</span> for less than 5 seconds, <span class="snormal">green</span> for 5 seconds or more that is less than 10, <span class='slow'>orange</span> for 10 seconds or more that is less than 60, and <span class='vslow'>red</span> for 60 seconds or more.

- ***SQL Elapse Map***

  Displays a real-time chart for the elapsed times of running queries. If you drag a specific part of the chart, the ***Query List*** appears. You can enlarge or reduce the range of the vertical axis by selecting ![Up arrow icon](/img/up-arrow.svg) or ![Down arrow icon](/img/down-arrow.svg).

  :::note

  The execution times of queries are calculated after collecting active sessions. Therefore, depending on the active session collection cycle, there may be a margin of error. See the following figure. The execution times of SQL queries that have ended within the collection cycle are not calculated. A shorter collection cycle may decrease the margin of error, but considering the database load, it is typically set to 5 seconds. It is useful for monitoring long-running queries. The same is true for the data in ***SQL statistics***.

  :::

- ***Wait Event***

  It displays a real-time graph for the names of the waiting events that each backend process is waiting on, along with the frequency with which those events occurred. It mainly monitors waiting events related to application, configuration, administrative, network, and the like. You can visually see the frequency of each waiting event. If you hover your mouse over the graph, a tooltip is displayed providing more information about each waiting event.

- ***Physical Reads***

  This widget monitors physical reads occurring in the database. It monitors the I/O performance of the database, by providing statistics on the operations where the database reads data from the disk.

- ***Excute Count***

  This widget monitors the numbers of queries or procedures executed in the database. It traces the numbers of queries or procedures executed by the database in real time and provides them to the user.

- ***Session Logical Reads***

  This widget monitors logical reads executed in the database session. It traces and provides real-time visibility to users on the number of logical read operations executed in the database session.
