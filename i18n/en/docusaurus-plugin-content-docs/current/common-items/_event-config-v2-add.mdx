## Adding event

You can edit a basic event template to add your own notification.

1. On the upper right of the screen, select <Cmdname sid="add_alert_setting" className="uitext" />.

2. Select an event to add from the template list.

3. Set the options in the <Cmdname sid="TTL07363" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL07363" className="uitext" />, and <Cmdname sid="TTL07364" className="uitext" /> sections in turn.

4. After all settings are made, select <Cmdname sid="save" className="uitext" /> on the upper right of the screen.

You can see newly added events in the event list.

:::note

- To use it differently from basic event templates, edit the <Cmdname sid="event_title" className="uitext" /> item and then save it.
