If any problem occurs such as a memory leak while running the Java application, you can generate its dump file for analysis of the problem. Select <Cmdname sid="dump_heap" className="uitext" />. The generated dump file is stored on the application server. You can see it in the *dump* directory under the path where you installed the agent.

:::note

This function is supported in Java agent 1.5.2 or later. Set the `heapdump_enabled` option to `true` in the agent configuration. Select <Cmdname sid="dump_heap" className="uitext" /> to enable the function to create a heap dump file. It does not automatically generate a heap dump each time, and this option does not affect the performance. However, dump acquisition may affect the performance.

**Obtaining a heap dump** requires a significant **burden**. Separate from the burden, because the execution of the application code is stopped (stop the world) until all heap dumps are extracted, the perceived performance difference by the user may be more severe.
