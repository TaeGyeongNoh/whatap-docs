It provides useful information for diagnosing performance issues by analyzing SQL statements executed on the database. The <Cmdname sid="side_dbSqlAnalysis" className="uitext" /> menu consists of two key tabs. 

- ***Access Statistics***: You can check the SQL that caused Full Scan, which may be the cause of the performance degradation.

- ***Plan Change History***: It detects the case when a SQL statement with the same SQL ID is changed to a different execution plan by the optimizer. This can affect the performance and needs to be monitored.

## Access Statistics {#access_statistics}

You can check the SQL that caused Full Scan, which may be the cause of the performance degradation. You can check the number of Full Scan occurrences by time and type. This allows you to optimize SQL statements that frequently cause Full Scan and optimize resource usage by reducing unnecessary full scans. Also consider replacing Full Scan with Index Scan to improve the query performance.

Select the query time and target on the screen. Select the <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="instance" className="uitext" /> options, and then select ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png). If necessary, you can filter the desired query results by setting the <Cmdname sid="filter" className="uitext" /> option.

- ***Access Count***: This bar graph chart allows you to check the number of Full Scan occurrences by the time zone. When you select a specific time zone, a list of SQLs performed during the selected time is displayed in the list at the bottom of the screen and in the ***Operation Count*** chart on the right.

- ***Operation Count***: You can check the type and number of full scans that occurred. You can see the object name by hovering your mouse over each bar.

### Filtering the searched results

You can filter the results in the queried SQL list based on **Full Scan** or **Index Scan** through the <Cmdname sid="filter" className="uitext" /> option.

1. Select the <Cmdname sid="filter" className="uitext" /> option.

   <ImgLang img="db-analysis-sql-access-statistics-filter.png" desc="Filter" />

2. In <Cmdname sid="TTL06737" className="uitext" />, select ***FULL*** or ***INDEX***.

3. Select <Cmdname sid="apply" className="uitext" />.

4. To apply the selected conditions to the SQL list, select the ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png) button.

:::note

To search all for Full Scan and Index Scan, in <Cmdname sid="TTL06737" className="uitext" />, select all options for ***FULL*** and ***INDEX***. Or by selecting the ![Plus icon](/img/ic-s-plus.svg) button, you add more filtering options.

## Plan Change History {#plan_change_history}

It detects the case when a SQL statement with the same SQL ID is changed to a different execution plan by the optimizer. This can affect the performance and needs to be monitored. By detecting and responding to performance changes due to plan changes, you can identify unnecessary plans and maintain the consistent SQL performance.

<ImgLang img="db-analysis-sql-plan-change-history.png" desc="Plan Change History" />

Select the query time and target on the screen. Select the <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="instance" className="uitext" /> options, and then select ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png).

***Plan Change Count***: This bar graph chart displays the number of plan changes by time zone. When you select a time zone, a list of plan changes for the selected time appears. When you select a changed item from the list, you can see the details before and after the plan change at the lower part of the screen.

<ImgLang img="db-analysis-sql-plan-change-history-diff.png" desc="Plan Change History" />

By comparing the differences before and after the plan change in detail, you can determine which change affected the performance.
