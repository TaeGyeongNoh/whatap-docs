- <Status priority='1'>Feature</Status> Provided the feature to trace undertow-server-2.3.0.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  weaving=undertow-2.3.0
  ```

- <Status priority='1'>Feature</Status> When the **Asynchronous Tracking** option is set and tracing is performed with the API provided by WhaTap, added the feature to trace the `CompletableFuture` method that operates even after the main thread ends.

  The `CompletableFuture` method is indicated as a step in the main transaction in <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />. The `(SubTx)` service connects transactions performed with CompletableFuture.

  > e.g. (SubTx)`${SERVICE_NAME}`
