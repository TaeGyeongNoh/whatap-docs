- <Status>Feature</Status> Added the integration method for Java applications and Kubernetes agents.

  - Added the container ID syncing feature by adding `WHATAP_JAVA_AGENT_PATH` value to the Java agent container environment variables.

  - It can view the proc information using the agent process ID, and extract WhaTap Java Home (`$WHATAP_HOME`) from the application container's process name by using the proc information.

  - If WhaTap Java Home (`$WHATAP_HOME`) is not found in the above procedure, extract WhaTap Java Home from the agent image by using the runtimeAPI.

  - It can check the version and format of the agent and perform the containerID syncing feature with a valid version only when the following criteria are met.

    1\. If the file name is *whatap.agent-`X.Y.Z`.jar* and the version is greater than or equal to 2.2.33 (`X.Y.Z` >= 2.2.33)

    2\. If the file name is *whatap.agent.kube.jar*

- <Status>Changed</Status> Changed the event collection method: collects data only for the events generated after agent startup (`kube_event`).
