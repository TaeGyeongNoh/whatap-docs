<Status priority='1'>Changed</Status> Adjusted the frequency at which the dmx agent is run with prx again.

- Default cycle **20 times**: The default cycle is 10 seconds, and can be set with the `interval` option in the *prx.conf* file.

- After that, it tries to re-run 10 times every minute, then 5 times every 10 minutes, and afterwards every hour.
