- <Status priority='1'>Feature</Status> Added the `tablespace` option.

  When querying the free space, a query timeout occurs. So a different view is provided depending on the option.

  - `tablespace=1`: **dba_free_space** is viewed.

  - `tablespace=2`: **dba_lmt_free_space** is viewed.

  - `tablespace=3`: **usage_metrics** is viewed.

- <Status priority='1'>Changed</Status> Added the sequence in `object_info`.

- <Status priority='0'>Fixed</Status> Fixed the **SIGSEGV** issue when there is any file with a long file name (32 characters or more) in the same path as the agent.
