- <Status priority='1'>New</Status> Added the feature to collect traces that occur outside of transactions.

  - **expand_transaction_level** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

    Default `false`

    If the option value is set to `true`, SQL and HTTP calls that occur outside of transactions are treated as transactions and displayed in the hitmap.

    Default `1000`(1 second) / Min `100`(0.1 second)

    When the `expand_transaction_level` option is `true`, data is collected only when the response time is longer than the set time. It collects up to 100 cases per second.
