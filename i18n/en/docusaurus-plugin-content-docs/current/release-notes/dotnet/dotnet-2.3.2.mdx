- <Status priority='1'>New</Status> Added the agent option to set suffix of URLs to exclude from transaction collection.

  **trace_ignore_url_suffix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  URLs that match the set suffix do not collect transaction performance. To set multiple items, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

- <Status priority='0'>Fixed</Status> Added the parameterized query tracing feature.

  :::note

  For agent options related to this feature (`profile_sql_param_enabled`), see [the following](../../dotnet/agent-dbsql).

  :::

- <Status priority='0'>Fixed</Status> Fixed the error occurring in the status code display of REST API transactions.

- <Status priority='0'>Fixed</Status> Added the methods related to `System.Data.Common.DbCommand` that are not included in monitoring.

  Added some missing overloaded methods among the following asynchronous methods.

  - `ExecuteReaderAsync`
  - `ExecuteNonQueryAsync`
  - `ExecuteScalarAsync`
