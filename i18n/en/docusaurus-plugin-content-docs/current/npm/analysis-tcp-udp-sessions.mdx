Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="analysis" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="MNU06850" className="uitext" /> or <Cmdname sid="MNU06851" className="uitext" />

The session data collected by agents can be used to identify failure points in detail. It provides the filters that allow you to set multiple conditions to efficiently identify data. The identified data can be downloaded in CSV format for other purposes.

<ImgLang img="npm-analaysis-tcp-udp.png" desc="Session Search" />

Set a desired ![Number 1](/img/number-01.png) time, and then select ![Number 2](/img/number-02.png) ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png). The table displays the data that meets the set conditions.

:::note

- After setting new data search conditions, select ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png) to output the target data.

- This function uses raw data. It provides up to 5 cases per minute based on one agent.

:::

## Setting the lookup time

You can see the data by setting a desired time.

<ImgLang img='flexboard-time-set-select.png' desc='시간 선택 모드' className='noneborder' />

- You can click the green button to select a desired time. It can be set up to 1 hour.

- By selecting ![Left Arrow icon](/img/left-arrow.svg) or ![Right Arrow icon](/img/right-arrow.svg), you can move by the time set on the green button.

- If you click the text range for date and time, the option appears to select the date and time.

## Setting for the session data search

### Configuring the inbound/outbound conditions

<ImgLang img="npm-analysis-select-in-out.png" desc="" />

Before setting the search conditions, select the following traffic types.

- **_In_**: Inbound traffic

- **_Out_**: Outbound traffic

### Setting the filter conditions

You can see the data by setting multiple filter conditions for tag and field values. Conditions are added by the `&&` (and) condition. For example, to search the session data with the `ProcessType` tag value of "agencyrun" and the `Session Count` field value greater than 2, set as follows.

<ImgLang img="npm-analysis-filtering.png" desc="Tag filtering" />

:::tip

You can filter with the `||` (or) condition when duplicate tags or field values have been set as follows:

```text
Local Process Type == agencyrun, Local Process Type == dev-yard
```

:::

1. Select the Filter field to see the list of available filters.

   You can select the string format (`text`) and the numeric format (`numeric`).

   <ImgLang img='npm-analysis-field-list.png' desc='Field list' />

2. Select a filter and then select <Cmdname sid="operator" className="uitext" />(`Operator`). 

   Depending on the string format and numeric format, the operator you can select may differ.

   - String format<br/><ImgLang img='npm-analysis-filter-text-operater.png' desc='' />

   - Numeric format<br/><ImgLang img='npm-analysis-filter-numeric-operater.png' desc='' />

3. If a string format is selected, the list of available values appears. Select a desired value. In case of a numeric format, enter it directly.

   <ImgLang img='npm-analysis-filter-text-val-list.png' desc='' />

4. Select a desired value or enter a number. To add filters, press Enter and then repeat the above steps.

5. Select ![Search icon](/img/ico-btn-search.png) to the right of the Filter field.
