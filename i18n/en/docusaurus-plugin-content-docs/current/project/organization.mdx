An organization is a parent group to which groups can belong. In most situations, projects and groups are enough. However, in case of a business that specializes in the operations management service, multiple companies exist as a group. The number of groups and projects can be great. In this case, the group concept is not enough. We need one more concept to integrate groups for management. Use the organization concept.

A professional maintenance service company can group multiple subgroups into a single organization at a parent level. Grant each group member the corresponding roles. Members who have been granted roles can manage the group independently.

## Create Organization

1. Select the profile icon on the upper right of the screen. A drop-down menu appears.

2. Select <Cmdname sid="create_organization" className="uitext" />.

3. Enter values for <Cmdname sid="organization_name" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="site_logo" className="uitext" />, and <Cmdname sid="description" className="uitext" />, and then select <Cmdname sid="next" className="uitext" />.

4. In the group list, select a group to add in the organization and then click <Cmdname sid="complete" className="uitext" />.

If the <Cmdname sid="success_create_organization" className="uitext" /> message appears, the organization has been created successfully.

:::note

- <Cmdname sid="organization_name" className="uitext" /> is required. Even if you have not entered the <Cmdname sid="site_logo" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="description" className="uitext" />, the organization can be created.

- The group with the editing permission can be added to an organization.

- If there is no editing permission, the group cannot be selected.

- If you do not select a group, an organization can be created.

- If invited to the group without editing permission, it does not have editing permission for the group.

- It cannot be deleted by the upper group or cannot be moved to another group.

- The recommended size of the organization <Cmdname sid="site_logo" className="uitext" /> image is 102 pixels wide and 102 pixels high. 

- The organization <Cmdname sid="site_logo" className="uitext" /> images can allow _png_, _jpg_, or _jpeg_ file extensions of 3 MB or less.

- For more information about the member roles, see [the following](project-structure#project-auth).
