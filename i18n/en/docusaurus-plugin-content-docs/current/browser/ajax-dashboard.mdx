AJAX is short for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It refers to using the `XMLHttpRequest` object to communicate with the server. 

AJAX is an important data loading method to construct a dynamic screen among resource data. If AJAX is not called normally, the normal screen cannot be provided to end users. The collected data can help us identify what hinders the user experience.

import Dashboardnote from "./_dashboard-note.mdx";

- **2xx** (Success): The requests have been successfully received, recognized, and accepted.

- **3xx** (Redirection): Additional action is required to complete the request.

- **4xx** (Client Error): The syntax of the request is incorrect or the request cannot be processed.

- **5xx** (Server Error): The server failed to meet a valid request.

- **Request Fail** (request failure): It indicates that no response was received from the server and the request failed. For example, the requests are canceled from the front due to a timeout, or the requests are made incorrectly.
