Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_statistics" className="uitext" /> &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_pageLoadStatistics" className="uitext" />

The <Cmdname sid="side_pageLoadStatistics" className="uitext" /> menu provides the load performance data for each page of the website. This menu allows you to trace in detail how each page is loaded, identify pages that are underperforming, and analyze the performance of improved pages. You can also get useful information to improve user experience of the web application.

- It provides load performance statistics for each page URL path.

- You can check the statistics based on the average, maximum, minimum, and percentile.

- You can analyze the performance in detail by filtering on the detailed time while page loading.

- The navigation timing API provides statistics by collecting the time data for each step for page loading.

:::note

For more information about the data collected in <Cmdname sid="side_pageLoadStatistics" className="uitext" />, see [the following](collect-data#pageloadtime).

## Basic usage guide

Various performance metrics are provided such as page load time, DOM load time, network latency, and resource load time based on the page URL path. This helps you determine if the page has been optimized for performance.

<ImgLang img="browser-pageload-statistics.png" desc="Page Load Statistics" />

1. Set the date and time to view the performance metrics in <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" />.

2. Select the desired criteria in <Cmdname sid="TTL08276" className="uitext" />.

3. Select ![Search icon](/img/ic-search-on-press.svg) on the upper right of the screen.

You can see the performance metrics of the time range searched for through graph charts and lists in each section. If you hover the mouse over the graph chart in each section, the metric information for the time zone appears.

### Setting the lookup time

Set the date and time to view the performance metrics in <Cmdname sid="time" className="uitext" />.

- Select the green button on the utmost right, you can select from various time ranges. 

  <ImgLang img="browser-statistics-set-time-select-options.png" className="width-600" desc="Time setting" />

- By selecting ![Left arrow icon](/img/left-arrow.svg) or ![Right arrow icon](/img/right-arrow.svg), you can shift the time. The shifting interval is the time interval set on the right.

- Click the Date & Time area to manually select the desired date and time.

  <ImgLang img="browser-statistics-set-custom-time.png" desc="Time setting" />

:::note

- The maximum time you can select is 3 days, and the minimum selectable time is 5 minutes.

- If you select a range of 2 hours or less, data is retrieved every 5 minutes. If it exceeds 2 hours, data is retrieved every 1 hour.

### Selecting statistical criteria

<Cmdname sid="TTL08276" className="uitext" /> is an option that allows users to check the statistical metrics to analyze based on the following selection criteria:

- <Cmdname sid="merge_avg" className="uitext" />: It provides statistics by calculating the average load times for each page.

- <Cmdname sid="merge_max" className="uitext" />: It provides statistics based on the maximum load times for each page. It indicates that you can identify which page URL has the most inefficient page load time.

- <Cmdname sid="merge_min" className="uitext" />: It provides statistics based on the minimum load times for each page. This allows you to identify which page URL has been loaded under the most optimal conditions. It is useful when setting the performance optimization goals.

- <Cmdname sid="ITM08291" className="uitext" />: It provides statistics of the load times for each page percentile.

  - <Cmdname sid="TTL08288" className="uitext" replace="95" />: It is the slowest 5% of page load times, which represents the experience of the top 5% of users who experienced the slowest page load times.

  - <Cmdname sid="TTL08288" className="uitext" replace="90" />: This page load time corresponds to the slowest 10% of users, and is useful to identify performance issues primarily among slow user group.

  - <Cmdname sid="TTL08288" className="uitext" replace="75" />: It displays the load times of the top 25% of users whose page load times are slower than the bottom 75%.

  - <Cmdname sid="TTL08288" className="uitext" replace="50" />: The median means that half of all users loaded the page faster than the time, and half of them loaded the page slower.

:::tip

- <Cmdname sid="merge_avg" className="uitext" /> is useful for getting an overall performance status, but it can be difficult to detect cases where performance degradation occurs intermittently. At this time, by using the <Cmdname sid="merge_max" className="uitext" /> and <Cmdname sid="ITM08291" className="uitext" /> options together, you can check the time when the performance degradation occurred and how severe it was.

- <Cmdname sid="merge_min" className="uitext" /> can be used as a reference when setting the performance optimization goals or evaluating how effective a specific optimization is. However, because it is difficult to evaluate the consistency of performance with this value alone, it is recommended to analyze the statistical data together with the <Cmdname sid="merge_avg" className="uitext" /> or <Cmdname sid="ITM08291" className="uitext" /> option.

- The <Cmdname sid="ITM08291" className="uitext" /> option is ideal for analyzing performance data at a more precise level than simple averages, providing valuable data for improving user experience. This option allows you to identify the percentage of users experiencing performance degradation and effectively select the target pages to optimize.
