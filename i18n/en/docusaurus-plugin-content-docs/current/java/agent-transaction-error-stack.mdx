The following guides you to the agent configuration options that detect errors during transactions in Java applications and display stack traces. It collects errors from various areas such as transactions, methods, SQLs, HTTP calls, and SOCKET calls, and includes methods how to set the error stack length, title length, and such. It helps you improve error handling through agent settings and support more efficient error diagnosis for applications.

It is not related to the `status_code` of the calling service. When multiple errors occur, the error stack displays only the first error stack.

:::note

The agent configuration in this document is supported by **Java Agent 2.2.15** or later.

## Agent CONFIG.

### Total configuration

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Whether or not to display error stacks
trace_exception_stack=false

# Default value for the error stack size
trace_exception_depth=50

# Title size of the error stack message
trace_exception_title_len=128
```

### Method

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Whether or not to display the method error stack
# You can turn the feature on or off with true/false values, following the trace_exception_stack value.
trace_method_error_stack=trace_exception_stack

# Method error stack size
# You can follow the trace_exception_depth value and set it separately.
trace_method_error_depth=trace_exception_depth
```

### SQL

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Whether or not to display the SQL error stack
# You can turn the feature on or off with true/false values, following the trace_exception_stack value.
trace_sql_error_stack=trace_exception_stack

# SQL error stack size
# You can follow the trace_exception_depth value and set it separately.
trace_sql_error_depth=trace_exception_depth
```

### HTTP Call

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Whether or not to display the HTTP call error stack
# You can turn the feature on or off with true/false values, following the trace_exception_stack value.
trace_httpc_error_stack=trace_exception_stack

# HTTP call error stack size
# You can follow the trace_exception_depth value and set it separately.
trace_httpc_error_depth=trace_exception_depth
```

### SOCKET

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Whether or not to display the socket error stack
# You can turn the feature on or off with true/false values, following the trace_exception_stack value.
trace_socket_error_stack=trace_exception_stack

# Socket error stack size
# You can follow the trace_exception_depth value and set it separately.
trace_socket_error_depth=trace_exception_depth
```

### Transactions

```ini title='whatap.conf'
# Whether or not to display the transaction error stack
# You can turn the feature on or off with true/false values, following the trace_exception_stack value.
trace_endtx_error_stack=trace_exception_stack

# Transaction error stack size
# You can follow the trace_exception_depth value and set it separately.
trace_endtx_error_depth=trace_exception_depth
```
