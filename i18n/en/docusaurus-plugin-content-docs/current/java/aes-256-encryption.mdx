title: AES 256 encryption
description: The following guides you to the encryption method when transmitting the data collected by Java agents to the server. Data security is enhanced using XOR operation and AES encryption. The 128-bit encryption is supported by default, but Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) must be updated for AES 256-bit encryption.

The WhaTap application agent transfers the collected data after encryption. For this purpose, the XOR (Exclusive-OR) operation and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption are used. Encryption and decryption are performed by dividing plaintext into 128-bit units. To enhance security, the encryption can be extended up to 256 bits.

The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) supports 128 bits by default. To apply the AES 256, JCE must be updated.

If you apply AES 256 in the default environment, the following error occurs.

```bash
Unsupported keysize or algorithm parameters.
##Or
Illegal key size or default parameters.
```

1. Download the file for your version from the following links.

2. Overwrite the file in the _`$JAVA_HOME`/jre/lib/security_ path.

3. If JCE has been applied, add the following settings in _`${WHATAP_HOME}`/whatap.conf_.

   ```ini title='whatap.conf'
   cypher_level=256
   ```

4. Once the application server has been restarted, the ACE 256 encryption is applied.
