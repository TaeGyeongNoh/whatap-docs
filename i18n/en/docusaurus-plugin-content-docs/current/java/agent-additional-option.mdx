The following guides you to additional agent configuration options that can help you tailor the level of monitoring for Java applications. It includes collection of SQL parameters, collection of HTTP parameters and header data, extraction of user IPs, selection of user count tracing method, SAP function tracking, and the like. Through these options, more granular data collection and analysis can be tailored, especially in security-critical environments.

The following are the options excluded from the agent default settings. If necessary, you can add the following options for application.

  Default `false`

  It collects HTTP headers.

- **trace_http_client_ip_header_key** <span class='type'>String</span>
