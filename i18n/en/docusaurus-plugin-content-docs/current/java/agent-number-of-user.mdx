The following explains how to count the number of users connected to the Java web application server through agent settings. It includes the setting whether to enable real-time user counting, setting of the cookie limit to count users, the method how to count users based on the IP address or specific HTTP header values, and setting of HTTP headers to trace client IPs.

- **trace_user_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Set whether or not to aggregate real-time users. If the user tracing option setting is duplicated, the action priority is as follows.

  > 1. **trace_user_using_ip** / **wclient_using_ip**
  > 2. **trace_user_using_jsession**
  > 3. **user_header_ticket** / **wclient_header_ticket**

  :::note

  In case of Java Agent 2.2.0 or later, use the `wclient_using_ip` and `wclient_header_ticket` options.
