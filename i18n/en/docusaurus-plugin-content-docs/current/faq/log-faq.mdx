### Restoration of the original log

> Can I recover the original logs after collecting them?

The function to restore the original logs is not provided. Currently, log collection is provided for analysis, not for security.

### Log data deletion cycle

> What is the log data deletion cycle?

It is the same as **_Data retention_** set in **_Log Configuration_**. However, because the loaded log retention period is in hours, data may remain for 1 hour in addition to the setting in **_Data retention_**.

:::note

If **_Data retention_** has not been set, the default value is 1 day. For more information about the setting in **_Data retention_**, see [the following](../log/log-setting#log-data-setting).

### Agent logs transmission cycle

> What is the log transmission cycle from the agent?

Logs are sent when the agent's log buffer capacity (64 KB) or transmission cycle (2 seconds) is reached. It is compressed in a _zip_ file and transmitted during network transmission, and is decompressed and stored when received from the collection server.

### Integrating with third-party log solutions

> Can it integrate with other log solutions?

Currently, integration with third-party log solutions is not provided.
