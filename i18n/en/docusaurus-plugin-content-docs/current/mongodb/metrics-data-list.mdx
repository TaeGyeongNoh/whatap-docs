Database metrics are comprehensive data collected for database workloads and resource usages. The WhaTap monitoring service continuously collects metric data to identify bottlenecks in the database and provides data to help identify the root cause of the performance issue.

MongoDB collects key metrics from `db.serverStatus`, and the following lists the descriptions for the collected key metrics: For more information about other metrics, see [the following](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/serverStatus/#output/).
