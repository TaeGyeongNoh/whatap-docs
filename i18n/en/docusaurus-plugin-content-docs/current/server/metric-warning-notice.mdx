## Composite metrics event templates{#composite-metrics-template}

To add a composite metrics event, select **_+_** <Cmdname sid="create_new_composite_mxql_event" className="uitext" /> and a template. It provides a template that generates alerts based on the thresholds set by the metrics for CPU, disk I/O, and network I/O.

### CPU

:::note 

CPU-related metrics are `cpu`, `user_cpu`, and `system_cpu`.

:::

#### **_CPU % is too high_**

The alert occurs when the highest CPU-related metric measured in the last minute matches any condition (`>`, `<`, `=`) of the threshold setting (`${_rule_}`). The alert occurs for each agent (oname). The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> CPU utilization rate of the `${oname}` in the last minute > `${_rule_}` %

#### **_CPU User % is too high_**

The alert occurs when the highest `user_cpu` metric measured in the last minute matches any condition (`>`, `<`, `=`) of the threshold setting (`${_rule_}`). The alert occurs for each agent (oname). The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> CPU User utilization rate of the `${oname}` in the last minute > `${_rule_} `%

#### **_The number of agents with high CPU SYS % is too large_**

The alert occurs when the number of servers whose `system_cpu` metric is 70% or more matches any condition (`>`, `<`, `=`) of the threshold setting (`${_rule_}`). The alert occurs for each agent (oname). The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows: 

> The number of agents with a CPU SYS of 70% or more in the last minute > `${_rule_}`

### Disk

#### **_The Disk I/O is too high_**

The alert occurs when the highest disk I/O metric measured in the last minute matches any condition (`>`, `<`, `=`) of the threshold setting (`${_rule_}`). The alert occurs for each agent (oname). The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> In the last minute, `${oname}`'s Disk I/O > `${_rule_}` %

#### **_The Disk Used % is too high_**

The alert occurs when the highest user I/O metric measured in the last minute matches any condition (`>`, `<`, `=`) of the threshold setting (`${_rule_}`). The alert occurs for each agent (oname). The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> In the last minute,`${oname}`'s Disk Used > `${_rule_}` %

### Network

#### **_Network Traffic I/O is too high_**

The alert occurs when the highest Network I/O metric measured in the last minute matches any condition (`>`, `<`, `=`) of the threshold setting (`${_rule_}`). The alert occurs for each agent (oname). The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> In the last minute, `${oname}`'s Network Traffic I/O > `${_rule_}` %

#### **_Network Packet I/O is too high_**

The alert occurs when the highest Network Packet I/O metric measured in the last minute matches any condition (`>`, `<`, `=`) of the threshold setting (`${_rule_}`). The alert occurs for each agent (oname). The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

> In the last minute, `${oname}`'s Network Packet I/O > `${_rule_}` %

#### **_Network Error I/O is too high_**

The alert occurs when the highest Network Error I/O metric measured in the last minute matches any condition (`>`, `<`, `=`) of the threshold setting (`${_rule_}`). The alert occurs for each agent (oname). The <Cmdname sid="message" className="uitext" /> example is as follows:

>  In the last minute, The maximum value of the `${oname}`'s Network Error I/O > `${_rule_}` %
