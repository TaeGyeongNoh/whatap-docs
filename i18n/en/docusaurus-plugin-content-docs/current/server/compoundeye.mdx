Compound Eye gives you a complete view of all servers where WhaTap agents have been installed. You can check the resource status of large-scale servers at a glance. It provides a visual view rather than sampling or summary for large-scale server resources.

## Provided information

![Compound Eye sc](/img/compound-eye.png)

It displays information with an eye. It provides 5 different data.

- <font color='73C2FC'>CPU</font>: CPU usage

- <font color='C0CA33'>Memory</font>: Memory usage

- <font color='7632FF'>Disk</font>: Disk usage

- <font color='00BEB8'>Rx</font>: Network Rx (received amount)

- <font color='0076AC'>Tx</font>: Network Tx (transmitted amount)

:::note

Network <font color='00BEB8'>Rx</font>/<font color='0076AC'>Tx</font> You can look at the network Rx/Tx usage metrics to see if external attacks like DDoS are coming from multiple servers at a time.

## Anomaly occurrence

![Resource map](/img/compoundeye-chart-ab.png)

When an anomaly occurs on the server, each Eye expresses the condition with a color.

- <span class='ov10'>Red</span>: Fatal condition

- <span class='wer'>Orange</span>: Alert condition

- <span class='mstop'>Gray</span>: Monitoring paused

In addition, when the mouse cursor is placed on the server, each individual pop-up message appears with numerical data. If you click on a server, the server's summary page appears for more information.

## Traffic Max Value option

Because the amount of traffic may change depending on the network environment, the maximum traffic can be adjusted. If you set the desired maximum traffic value, the Rx/Tx graph changes depending on the value.
