After installation of the **feature project** (<code class='Features'>Features</code>), the following explains how to disable data collection while keeping the server agent, or completely remove the server agent.

## Keeping the agent and disabling data collection

To keep the server agent running and disable the feature project data collection, remove the related settings from the *whatap.conf* file and then restart the `whatap-infra` service. See the following example: 

1. Remove the following settings from *whatap.conf*.

   ```bash title='whatap.conf'
   internal.forwarder.enabled=true
   telegraf.sidecar.enabled=true
   telegraf.sidecar.executable=/usr/whatap/infra/feature/telegraf
   ```
2. After modifying the settings, restart the `whatap-infra` service. 

   ```bash
   systemctl restart whatap-infra
   ```

## Agent deletion

To completely remove the server agent and feature project, see [the following](/server/agent-remove/).
