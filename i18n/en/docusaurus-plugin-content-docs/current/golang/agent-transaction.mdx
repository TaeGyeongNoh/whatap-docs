## Transaction tracing{#trs-trc}

The following agent options allow you to trace the execution paths of each transaction within applications in detail. You can adjust various aspects, from the minimum response time to the number of execution steps for transactions.

- **profile_basetime** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

  Default `500`

  Transaction trace data is not collected if a transaction is terminated within the set value. The first URL called in every 5 minutes and the erroneous profile data are collected.

- **profile_step_normal_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `1000`

  Set the maximum step count for tracing transactions.

- **profile_step_max_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `1024`

  Set the maximum number of trace steps. If the number of collected trace steps exceeds this value, all steps collected later are ignored.

  :::caution

  If you increase the setting too high, the memory usage increases. We recommend that you do not change the default values. 

  :::

- **profile_step_heavy_count** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `1000`

  If the collection number of basic steps is exceeded, only the steps whose execution time exceeds profile_step_heavy_time are collected. Set the count of the step that can be collected. In case of default settings, if `profile_step_normal_count` is 800, up to 200 steps are collected.

- **profile_step_heavy_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

  Default `100`

  Set the criterion of heavy steps. If the execution time is greater than the set value and `profile_step_normal_count` is exceeded, recording is made within `profile_step_heavy_count`.

- **query_string_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  It enables the function to collect query strings of the transaction URL together. It is applied to only the URLs registered in `query_string_urls`.

- **query_string_urls** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Register URLs to collect query strings from every transaction.

- **split_profile_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  More profiles are collected by separating a certain amount of profiles into virtual transactions. They are divided into multiple transaction lists.

  :::note

  If set at the same time, the priorities are as follows: 

  1. split

  2. large

  3. circular

  :::

- **large_profile_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  By sending split and compressed profiles, you can collect more profiles without increasing memory usage.

  :::note

  - We can collect up to 10,000 profiles (steps). For more data, it is recommended to use the `split_profile_enabled` option.

  - If set at the same time, the priorities are as follows: 

    1. split

    2. large

    3. circular

  :::

- **circular_profile_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  The last 1024 profiling data is collected. 

  :::note

  If set at the same time, the priorities are as follows: 

  1. split

  2. large

  3. circular

  :::

- **profile_zip_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Compressed profiles are transmitted. The default value is `true`.

- **trace_active_transaction_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

  Default `3000`

  In the active transaction arc equalizer graph on the dashboard that checks collected data, specify the criteria for the transaction response time that can be recorded as a slow section. If the transaction response time exceeds the set time, the number of slow active transactions is included.

- **trace_active_transaction_very_slow_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

  Default `8000`

- **trace_active_transaction_lost_time** <span class='type'>Millisecond</span>

  Default `300000`

  If a transaction does not end within the timeout period (5 minutes), no further transaction data is collected. You can see `Lost Connection` in the transaction trace information.

- **trace_useragent_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  If the value is `true`, the user agent data for transactions is collected. 

- **trace_referer_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  If the value is `true`, the referer data for transactions is collected.

## Exceptional handling {#exception}

The following options are used to manage and monitor exceptions that occur in applications. You can check the stability of applications by registering business exceptions and collecting related statistics. Exception-handled items appear as normal transactions in the <Cmdname sid="side_hitmap" className="uitext" /> or <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" /> window.

- **biz_exceptions** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set a specific error or exception as business exception. It is not recorded as an error in the hitmap but collected in the statistics. It is applied the same as the error class name that is collected. Multiple items can be registered using comma (,) as the delimiter.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  biz_exceptions=*errors.errorString, *echo.HTTPError, *url.Error, *exceptions.CustomErrors
  ```

  :::tip

  Error class collection/Hitmap display level: Includes the <span class="normal">INFO</span> (blue)/error statistics.

  :::

- **ignore_exceptions** <span class='type'>String</span>

  The error itself by the registered exception is ignored. The string to exclude is for the class related to the error type or error statistics in the profile.

  The type of error that occurs in Go is displayed as a string.

  ```go
  thr.ErrorClassName = fmt.Sprintf("%T", err)
  thr.ErrorMessage = err.Error()

  # Output the error type

  *errors.errorString
  *echo.HTTPError
  *url.Error
  ```

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  ignore_exceptions=*errors.errorString, *echo.HTTPError, *url.Error, *exceptions.CustomErrors
  ```

  :::tip

  Ignore error class/Hitmap display level: Excludes the <span class="normal">INFO</span> (blue)/error statistics.

  :::

## HTTP transaction tracing{#track-http-trs}

The following agent options trace and record various data related to HTTP requests and responses. This allows you to closely monitor and analyze the HTTP transactions for applications. You can add parameter values ​​to the transaction names or exclude specific URLs or HTTP methods. You can also record transactions in detail, including HTTP headers and parameters.

- **trace_normalize_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  It enables the function to convert and normalize transaction URLs.

- **trace_normalize_urls** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Set the target URL to transform and normalize. It deletes the path parameter by transforming the call URL patterns.      

  :::note

  For example, if it is set as `/a/{v}/b`, the called transaction URLs are transformed to the `/a/{v}/b` format. To register multiple items, comma (,) is used as the delimiter.

  :::

- **trace_ignore_url_set** <span class='type'>String</span>

  If a specific URL is set, the corresponding transactions are excluded from tracing. The set URLs are not displayed in the transaction list because they do not collect transaction data. Set URLs to exclude from transaction tracing. To set multiple items, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  :::note

  The URLs registered through this option are excluded from the <Cmdname sid="side_hitmap" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />, or <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window for collection.

  :::

- **trace_ignore_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It sets URL prefixes to exclude from the transaction tracing.

  :::note

  The URLs registered through this option are excluded from the <Cmdname sid="side_hitmap" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />, or <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window for collection.

  :::

- **profile_http_header_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  It is used to record the HTTP headers in the trace history.

- **profile_http_header_ignore_keys** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `host,accept,user-agent,referer, accept-language, connection`

  It is used to record HTTP headers in the profile details. The set HTTP header names are excluded from collection, and they are marked with "#."

- **profile_http_parameter_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span><ScrollToLink anchor='profile_http_parameter' />

  Default `false`

  It is used to record HTTP parameters in the trace history. The parameters can be viewed by entering a separate security key. The name and value of the text type are collected among Get and Post parameters. Up to 40 items (20 Gets, 20 Posts) are collected, and parameter names and values are collected up to 256 bytes.

  :::note

  - <code class="my">Go agent v2.4.0 or later</code>: The security key is set to 6 characters (`paramkey`) in the `WHATAP_HOME`*/security.conf* file where the *whatap.conf* file is located.

  - <code class="my"> Below Go agent v0.4.0 </code>: The security key is set to 6 characters within the `WHATAP_HOME`*/paramkey.txt* file where the *whatap.conf* file is located. If the *paramkey.txt* file does not exist, it is automatically created with a random value.

  :::

- **profile_http_parameter_url_prefix** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Default `/`

  It is used to define the prefix of URL to record HTTP parameters in the trace details.

- **profile_http_host_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  The transation host is output. If the value is `false`, only the URI is recorded in the URL of a transaction. If the value is `true`, the output has the format of `/xxx.aaa.com/URL`.

- **ignore_http_method** <span class='type'>String</span>

  Transactions requested by the specified HTTP method are not collected. To set multiple items, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  # e.g. tracing the transactions whose http_method is OPTIONS or HEAD
  ignore_http_method=PATCH,TRACE

  # e.g. ignoring the transactions whose http_method is OPTIONS or HEAD
  ignore_http_method=OPTIONS,HEAD
  ```

  :::note

  The HTTP methods registered through this option are excluded from the <Cmdname sid="side_hitmap" className="uitext" />, <Cmdname sid="TTL06209" className="uitext" />, or <Cmdname sid="TTL06527" className="uitext" /> window for collection.
