- **grpc_profile_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Set whether or not to collect the Google Remote Call (gRPC) data.

- **grpc_profile_stream_client_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Set whether or not to collect the client stream methods.

- **grpc_profile_stream_server_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  Set whether or not to collect the server stream methods.

- **grpc_profile_ignore_method** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It does not collect the method for the set value. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter.

- **grpc_profile_stream_method** <span class='type'>String</span>

  It organizes the set stream method as a separate transaction. For multiple values, use comma (,) as the delimiter. For long keeping stream connections, each method call is treated as a single transaction. You can search by the full method in the hitmap and transaction search.

- **grpc_profile_stream_identify** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `false`

  The stream full method is collected as a transaction name, and a prefix that can distinguish the client and server for the same full method is added.

  ```ini title='whatap.conf'
  grpc_profile_stream_identify=/StreamClient/[full method], /StreamServer/[full method]
  ```
