When the application server runs, it starts collecting the monitoring data. The collected data is stored in the log file.

- **log_rotation_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  The function to store agent log files by date is activated. The log file name is stored in the format of _whatap-'yyyymmdd'.log_. If the value is `false`, the log file name is stored in the format of _whatap.log_.

- **log_keep_days** <span class='type'>Int</span>

  Default `7`

  It sets the log file retention period. It works only when `log_rotation_enabled` is `true`.

- **log_datasource_lookup_enabled** <span class='type'>Boolean</span>

  Default `true`

  The function to record the log is activated in case of DataSource upon InitialContext Lookup.

- **log_root** <span class='type'>String</span>

  You can set the path for the agent log files. The _logs_ folder is created under the specified path, and the WhaTap log files are generated in this folder.

  If you set an agent option as in the following example, the path for creating the whatap log file is as follows:

  > <em>/Users/sample_user/workspace/nodejs_application/whatap_logs/logs/</em>

  ```ini title="whatap.conf"
  log_root=/Users/sample_user/workspace/nodejs_application/whatap_logs/
  ```
