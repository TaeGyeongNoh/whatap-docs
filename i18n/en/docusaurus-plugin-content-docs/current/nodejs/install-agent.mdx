To use the Node.js monitoring service, the monitoring agent must be installed on the monitored application. For installation, use NPM (Node Package Manager).

- Install the WhaTap agent module in the active Node.js application directory.

- Write the configuration of WhaTap agent (_whatap.conf_).

- Run the Node.js service again.

import Createprojectv2 from "../getting-started/_create-project-v2.mdx";

<Createprojectv2 />

import Accesskeyv2 from "../getting-started/_accesskey-v2.mdx";

<Accesskeyv2 />

## Download agent

1. Install the agent in the active Node.js application directory.

   ```bash
   $ npm install --save whatap
   ```

2. Copy the _whatap.conf_ file in the _node_modules/whatap_ path and then paste it into the root path of the project (same location as in the _package.json_ file).

3. Go to the [WhaTap Monitoring Service](https://service.whatap.io).

4. Select the created project and then copy the following among the **_downloaded items from the agent_** in the **_Install guide_** section.

   ```ini title='Example'
   license={access key}
   whatap.server.host={collection server IP}
   ```

5. Paste it into the _whatap.conf_ file.

The host (`whatap.server.host`) address is the server address in which the WhaTap proxy has been installed. You can use a forward slash (/) as the delimiter to enter all addresses of the servers where the proxy server is running among the WhaTap servers.

For the agent configuration file, see the following.

:::tip

Server-side rendering (SSR) frameworks such as **Next.js** and **Nuxt.js** require the Custom Server settings for application monitoring. It requires an approach different from typical Node.js frameworks (e.g. Express.js, Nest.js). For more information, see the following:

- [Agent installation in the Next.js environment](install-agent-nextjs)

- [Agent installation in the Nuxt.js environment](install-agent-nuxtjs)

:::

## Using

Add the following code at the top of the entry point (main module) file of the application. For example, in the Express.js application, _app.js_ and _server.js_ are the entry points (main module). When using a framework like Nest.js, _main.ts_ is the entry point.

```javascript title='Javascript'
var whatap = require('whatap').NodeAgent;
```

To use ECMAScript (ES), add the following code together.

```javascript title='ES'
import WhatapAgent from 'whatap';
WhatapAgent.NodeAgent;
```

See the following application example:

```javascript
var WhatapAgent = require('whatap').NodeAgent;
import http from 'http';
import setupApp from '../src/app';
let server = null;
const port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '3000');
```

:::note

Because the agent executable code needs to be run first after starting node.js, it must be placed before the first `import`.

:::

After installation, see [the following](install-check) to make sure there is no problem.

### Separating whatap.conf files for each environment

In the following cases, set the file names excluding .conf.

- In case of separating the projects for each environment

- In case the agent options are set differently

- In case of starting by pm2 in Cluster mode

```javascript
process.env.WHATAP_CONF = 'whatapdev';
process.env.WHATAP_NAME = 'NodeAgent-{ip2}-{ip3}-{cluster}';
var WhatapAgent = require('whatap').NodeAgent;
```

:::note

The arguments that can be set by the `WHATAP_NAME` option are as follows.

- **ipN**: ip0, ip1, ip2, ip3

- **cluster**: Cluster ID

- **pid**: Process ID

- **hostname**: Host name

:::

### Using the agent group unit function

Agent group unit function includes group topology and integrated topology. Replace `{group identifier}` with agent group name in the following code.

```javascript
process.env.WHATAP_OKIND = '{group identifier}';
var WhatapAgent = require('whatap').NodeAgent;
```

## PaaS application environment

### Configuring the default environment variables

When installing the agent in the PaaS application, all settings must be configured in the source file (_app.js_). The _whatap.conf_ file cannot be used.

Set the access key (`WHATAP_LICENSE`) and collection server IP (`WHATAP_SERVER_HOST`) as environment variables.

```javascript title='app.js'
process.env.WHATAP_LICENSE={Access Key};
process.env.WHATAP_SERVER_HOST={Collection Server IP};
var whatap=require('whatap').NodeAgent;
...
```

### Options that can be configured as environment variables

Because you cannot use the _whatap.conf_ file, set the WhaTap agent options as environment variables in the source file.

```javascript title='app.js'
process.env.profile_http_header_enabled=false;
process.env.profile_http_parameter_enabled=false;

process.env.profile_basetime=500;

process.env.auto_oname_enabled=false;
process.env.auto_oname_prefix='nodejs';

process.env.mtrace_rate=0;
process.env.mtrace_spec='v1';
process.env.stat_mtrace_enabled=false;
process.env.stat_domain_enabled=false;
```

:::note

For more information about the options that can be set in Node.js, see [the following](set-agent).

:::

## Starting the monitoring

Once the application server has been restarted, the agent starts collecting data.
