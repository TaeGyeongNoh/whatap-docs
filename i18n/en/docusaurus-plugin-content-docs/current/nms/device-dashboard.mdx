Home &gt; Select Project &gt; <Cmdname sid="side_dashboard" className="uitext" /> &gt; ***Device Dashboard***

***Device Dashboard*** provides real-time status and performance on network devices being monitored. ***Device Dashboard*** allows you to visually monitor various operational data such as device interface status, traffic, Syslog events, and SNMP trap messages.

## Basic screen guide

:::note 

***Device Dashboard*** is a real-time dedicated monitoring screen and does not provide the feature to select and view a past specific time point.

### <Cmdname sid="TTL09011" className="uitext" />

You can intuitively see the total number and usage of device interfaces and quickly find the number of active interfaces handling the network traffic. 

- It displays the number of active interfaces (***Connected***) / total number of interfaces (***Total Interfaces***) as a ratio.

- When you select a device to view, the ***Interface Status*** menu appears where you can see the interface details of the device.

- If you hover your mouse over a device to view, you can briefly check the main information of the device in a popover format. 

### <Cmdname sid="TTL09007" className="uitext" /> / <Cmdname sid="TTL09008" className="uitext" />

You can see the interfaces with high network load based on the network traffic and packet throughput (PPS, Packets Per Second). 

- It displays the interfaces that have recorded the highest throughput or packets per second (PPS) values ​​over the last 24 hours, and the corresponding times by device.

- High traffic interfaces are displayed in descending order based on the maximum value.

### <Cmdname sid="TTL08967" className="uitext" />

You can analyze Syslog events that have occurred on the device today, categorize them by severity, and view them in a pie chart format. You can quickly identify the causes of network failures based on the frequency and severity of log occurrences.

### <Cmdname sid="TTL08976" className="uitext" />

You can identify the devices where network events are concentrated based on the frequency of SNMP trap messages. Network operators can focus on inspecting devices with a sudden surge in event occurrences, allowing them to resolve issues at an early stage.

- It displays Top 10 devices with the most SNMP trap messages over the last 24 hours, sorted in descending order.

- You can analyze network events and failure occurrence patterns through the frequency of SNMP trap messages.

### <Cmdname sid="realtime_log_event" className="uitext" />

You can monitor event logs occurring in the devices and network infrastructure in real time.

- It displays the logs occurring in the project in real time, like Live Tail.

- It analyzes the logs in real time to quickly find system failures and anomalies.
